(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Hey humans, thanks for joining my podcast.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,000
This podcast is a place to share unedited

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,940
lived experiences regarding mental health.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,580
We'll touch on how it shows up in

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,240
our lives and provide some tips that have

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,700
worked for me and others on how to

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,260
manage it.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,810
There will be strong language and definitely the

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,590
potential for disturbing and or triggering content.

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,270
Please be aware of this and mindful of

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,170
others who may be in earshot.

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,670
Most importantly, and as horribly fucking cliche as

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,210
this sounds, you really do not have to

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,110
go through this alone.

15
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,810
And hopefully you'll see this and feel this

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,670
more and more as you listen.

17
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,830
And hey, if this podcast isn't for you,

18
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:48,750
that's fine.

19
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,830
There are lots of them out there.

20
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,670
Find one that speaks to you and helps

21
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,310
you.

22
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,330
So let's talk mental health.

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,340
And now the boilerplate and cover your ass

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:25,900
clause.

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,580
On this podcast, unless explicitly stated, no one

26
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,300
on this show is a medical professional in

27
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,000
any way.

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,260
And as such, no content on this show

29
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,520
is intended to be, whether implied or otherwise,

30
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,080
to be taken as medical advice.

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,480

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,120

need.

53
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,800
Hello humans.

54
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,200
With me today, I have my friend Brandon.

55
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,980
He's gonna talk a little about himself, give

56
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,760
you a little info on his background, and

57
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,500
then a little info on his experience with

58
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,260
mental health.

59
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,860
Brandon, thank you for joining.

60
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,420
Thank you for having me.

61
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,100
It's all you, buddy.

62
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,540
Tell us a little about yourself and then

63
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,600
your experience with mental health kind of briefly.

64
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,220
My name is Brandon.

65
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,420
I used to be a network engineer, then

66
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,960
an AV engineer, and now just a tech

67
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,360
guy.

68
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,000
It took two heart surgeries to get me

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,480
there, though.

70
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,260
I was in foster care for most of

71
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,620
my, well, yeah, for all my teenage years

72
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,000
and up until I was 21.

73
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,980
Before that, I lived with my dad and

74
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,420
my stepmom, but my stepmom was really abusive.

75
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,160
And then my foster care system wasn't, my

76
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,580
foster care experience wasn't the greatest either, so.

77
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,340
Sadly, that's quite common.

78
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:12,680
Okay.

79
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,860
Anything else you want to add before you

80
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,120
finish?

81
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,519
I didn't want to interrupt you, sorry.

82
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,620
You know, I'm so nervous, I can't think

83
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,040
of anything.

84
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,100
This isn't live.

85
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,460
I mean, it's just you and I.

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,500
Like, it's not live.

87
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,940
No, I know.

88
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,460
I know, but it's going to be out

89
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,480
there, so they'll see you.

90
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:28,880
Yeah.

91
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,460
Yeah.

92
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,900
Okay.

93
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,160
Thank you for joining.

94
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,440
Today we are talking about, why would someone

95
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,500
have to be at my door?

96
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,280
Hold on.

97
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:45,770
Okay.

98
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,070
So, today we are talking about toxic relationships.

99
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,990
I wanted to start by defining the good

100
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,010
old interwebs dictionary.

101
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,010
No, it's, I think Webster's, I think.

102
00:04:59,290 --> 00:04:59,890
Don't quote me.

103
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,810
What is a toxic relationship?

104
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,470
A toxic, oh, you know what?

105
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,370
First, let me ask you, Brandon, what do

106
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,550
you think a toxic relationship is?

107
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,090
I don't know, people who won't give in

108
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:19,010
things, would never give back, abusive relationships, manipulation.

109
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,430
Yeah.

110
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,050
Okay.

111
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,790
A toxic relationship refers to any relationship, whether

112
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:33,670
romantic, familial, platonic, even professional, that is emotionally

113
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,330
or physically harmful to one or both people

114
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:37,950
involved.

115
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,150
In a toxic relationship, negative behaviors, such as

116
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,290
manipulation, like you said, constant criticism, dishonesty, disrespect,

117
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,830
emotional abuse, or control, dominate the dynamic.

118
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,830
These behaviors undermine the emotional wellbeing of one

119
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,330
or both partners and can lead to long

120
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,050
-term damage to self-esteem, mental health, hi,

121
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,310
the reason for this podcast, and overall life

122
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:08,950
satisfaction.

123
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,130
So, that's a lot.

124
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,030
So, what are some key characteristics of that

125
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,850
entire big blurb?

126
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:17,930
Lack of respect.

127
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:23,250
So, one or both individuals are consistently either,

128
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:28,230
or consistently disregard each other's boundaries, their feelings,

129
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,250
or their needs.

130
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,550
Any or all of those.

131
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,790
Manipulation or control.

132
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,070
One person may try to dominate or control

133
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,630
the other through guilt, threats, or emotional blackmail.

134
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,490
Constant criticism is another one.

135
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:54,790
Rather than constructive feedback, criticism is harsh, very

136
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,690
belittling, and quite frequent.

137
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,070
Then you've got the lying, dishonesty, or secrecy.

138
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,810
There may be lies, deceit, or a lack

139
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,910
of transparency that, you know, kind of washes

140
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,790
away and erodes the trust.

141
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,910
Emotional or physical abuse, the most common.

142
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,790
This can range from verbal insults or horrible

143
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,530
comments, which I'm sure anyone who's experienced this

144
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,110
can think of a few right now, to

145
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,330
some serious forms, more serious forms like physical

146
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,230
harm or threats.

147
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,810
Inability to communicate healthily.

148
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:43,150
Affective and empathetic communication is typically absent in

149
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:49,430
a toxic relationship, often leading to misunderstandings, resentment,

150
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,270
or, you know, any conflicts, an escalation.

151
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,150
And then one that's common in so many

152
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,210
things, jealousy or possessiveness.

153
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:07,630
Extreme jealousy or extreme possessiveness can create an

154
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,810
unhealthy power dynamic, which will lead to emotional

155
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,490
distress, which then weighs on your mental health,

156
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,790
which then weighs on you, and then that

157
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,950
kind of spills out into the world around

158
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,250
you.

159
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:28,450
So, in these types of relationships, toxic, people

160
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:35,429
often feel tired, drained, exhausted, unhappy, unsupported.

161
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:42,270
And they may struggle to maintain their self

162
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,350
-esteem, their sense of self-worth, who they

163
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,530
are, and, hey, why am I, why am

164
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,410
I dealing with this?

165
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,470
Like, why, why am I doing this?

166
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:57,350
So, today's episode, it's important to recognize the

167
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:03,350
signs of a toxic relationship or relationships, I

168
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,570
guess you could be in multiple and not

169
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,790
know, and seek help or distance, you know,

170
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,710
yourself when necessary for, you know, you, personal

171
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,130
well-being.

172
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,830
Questions or comments, Brandon, on all of that?

173
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,850
Not particularly right now.

174
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,670
It's just, yeah, the long-term effects are

175
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,990
something people usually forget.

176
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:34,750
Yeah.

177
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,830
Once you're away from it, they just, oh

178
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,810
yeah, everything's better, but it doesn't work that

179
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,010
way.

180
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,010
Yeah.

181
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,370
I don't want to say it's a culture

182
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,650
of people, but there's some people who think

183
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,390
if you don't complain about something, I guess,

184
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,330
a lot, then either the pain or whatever

185
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,490
issue is, has stopped or gone away.

186
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,490
And it's like, no, I just don't want

187
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,870
to complain about it every day and just

188
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,550
kind of be seen or labeled as, oh,

189
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,930
you know, there's Christopher, he's here to complain

190
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,390
again.

191
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:12,810
Yeah.

192
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,330
So, you know, people kind of keep it

193
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:16,850
inside.

194
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,550
Okay.

195
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:26,070
So, for you, you can keep in your

196
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,770
mind's eye any relationship that you figured out

197
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,610
was toxic, and then you can talk about

198
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:34,870
it.

199
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,850
But my first question was, you know, what

200
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,430
specific thing flew you in that whatever relationship

201
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,470
you're about to talk about was toxic?

202
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:52,150
Probably the fear, just the distress of it.

203
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,770
Like I used to think about my dad

204
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,430
and him not being there and just terrified

205
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,990
of what would happen with my stepmom.

206
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,310
She was very manipulative and good at hiding

207
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,690
and intimidating me into not saying anything for

208
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,290
a long time.

209
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,030
Wow.

210
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:14,630
So the fear of abandonment by your dad.

211
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,470
Yeah.

212
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:16,810
Yeah.

213
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,750
I was always worried.

214
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,790
I'm not afraid.

215
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,950
I wasn't afraid that he would leave, more

216
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,530
of like afraid if he died or for

217
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,570
whatever reason wasn't still ultimately a form of

218
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,650
abandonment, not, you know, not intentional, but yeah.

219
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,150
Yeah.

220
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,290
Yeah.

221
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:32,390
Yeah.

222
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,490
You just heard the fear of being left

223
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,790
alone with your mom.

224
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:36,930
Stepmom.

225
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,770
Stepmom.

226
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,070
Sorry.

227
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,690
Stepmom.

228
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,430
I apologize.

229
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:51,710
So what I want to say patterns, but

230
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,390
every situation is kind of different.

231
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,270
But were there any patterns or that you

232
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,350
can think back on now patterns that you're

233
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,250
like, oh yeah, that was toxic.

234
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,150
Oh yeah.

235
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,110
That's not something that should have happened to

236
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,570
a child.

237
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,070
That, that was toxic.

238
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,670
Were, did you see any patterns going back

239
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,650
over however long?

240
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,550
Well, that's the manipulation.

241
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,450
So like I was intimidated from saying anything

242
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,270
and then she obviously wasn't going to say

243
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:22,570
anything.

244
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,170
So it was just a cycle of hiding

245
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,090
it from my dad.

246
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,230
Um, like one time she, uh, she thrown

247
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,330
a spoon at me and it, it hit

248
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,810
my eyebrow and left a big gash.

249
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,610
Um, and I ended up telling my dad

250
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,270
that it was my glasses that had pushed

251
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,070
against my face.

252
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,690
I'd like hit them hard or something.

253
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,250
Um, cause I was still just so afraid

254
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,710
of telling him what actually happened.

255
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,050
But you weren't afraid of his reaction.

256
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,530
You were afraid of her reaction.

257
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:50,550
Yeah.

258
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,710
I was afraid of her reaction.

259
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,210
And then I was also afraid that it

260
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:53,810
would hurt him.

261
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:54,730
Right.

262
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,810
Cause you know, he's the one biological parent

263
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,090
that I have.

264
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,730
And how old were you at this time?

265
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,750
I think that happened when I was around

266
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,470
10 or 11.

267
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,630
The whole thing started when I was around

268
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:10,990
five.

269
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,070
Okay.

270
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,060
So fear being left alone, not knowing what

271
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,380
your stepmother would do.

272
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:21,920
Got you.

273
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,640
And then fear of telling your dad because

274
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,160
you didn't know what she would do, but

275
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,740
also putting your dad's feelings before yours.

276
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,900
Um, unfortunately, um, that's where we've learned these

277
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,920
bad habits or not bad habits.

278
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,180
These mental health traits is where we get

279
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,840
them is our, our wonderful childhoods.

280
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,620
Um, yeah.

281
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,860
Um, so manipulation is the pattern.

282
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,200
Yeah.

283
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,080
Um, I'm surprised.

284
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,800
I know manipulation was in the definition, but

285
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,660
I'm actually surprised it wasn't talked about more

286
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,600
and I'm the host.

287
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,600
I should have done that note for future.

288
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:08,280
Um, so at that time, either, uh, it's

289
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,920
kind of young five, um, maybe when you

290
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,240
got older or older by meaning like seven

291
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,660
or eight or nine, how did it start

292
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,660
to, or when did you notice it affecting

293
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,520
your mental health and how it was kind

294
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,960
of spilling out into your outside relationships?

295
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,020
Um, I kind of realized a little earlier

296
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,720
that it, that it was bad, which I

297
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,100
mean, it's hard not to think something's bad

298
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,080
being abused.

299
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,680
Um, that's true.

300
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,260
I don't know.

301
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,480
I didn't repeat the question.

302
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,300
I already forgot.

303
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,040
It's okay.

304
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,300
Okay.

305
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,520
Um, at what age, not at what age,

306
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,720
um, when did you start noticing that what

307
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,100
was happening to you was affecting your mental

308
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,660
health?

309
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,480
And then also if it started to spill

310
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,380
out and started affecting other relationships you had

311
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,360
with people probably around second grade, um, in

312
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,540
second grade, I know that we moved away

313
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,840
from my, from my dad's family and they

314
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,600
were kind of like, they didn't know about

315
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,780
it at that time.

316
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,220
Um, but they were positive and loving, uh,

317
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,140
all those things.

318
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,300
So when we moved away from them, I

319
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,900
was more isolated and more able to recognize

320
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,980
what was going on.

321
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,560
Oh, okay.

322
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,720
Okay.

323
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,580
I gotcha.

324
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,600
Um, one of the, I, I looked up,

325
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,680
um, some common questions that are asked to

326
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,840
people about mental health.

327
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,800
Um, and one of them I wanted to

328
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,020
ask because when I first read it, I

329
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,500
laughed.

330
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,320
Um, and as I sit here and stare

331
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,900
at it again, it's not funny because I

332
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,000
think I get it in a different way.

333
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,160
But the question is, how long did it

334
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,500
take you to heal from this toxic relationship?

335
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,880
And then how did you heal?

336
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,680
Like, what did you do so to speak

337
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,460
that, uh, made you heal?

338
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,320
And the first time I read this, I

339
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,380
laughed cause I'm like, do you really heal

340
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,140
from something that traumatic?

341
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,580
But then I started thinking, well, what's the

342
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,660
point in, in therapy, um, forever, you know?

343
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,300
And why, why are you going through all

344
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,280
of this if you can't heal?

345
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,400
Um, and of course we just got the

346
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,880
notification about this app that our time limit

347
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,580
is coming up.

348
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,700
So if it cuts out, I'll just restart

349
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,340
it.

350
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,060
Um, and we'll just finish and I'll edit

351
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,420
it in.

352
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,480
So go ahead.

353
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,960
How, how, how did you heal?

354
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,340
How long did it take you to heal?

355
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,240
I mean, I'm, I'm still healing.

356
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,780
Um, it was really weird.

357
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,760
It didn't really, um, I mean, it did

358
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,400
a little bit, but I was probably really

359
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,400
good until, uh, so say around 25 or

360
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:07,900
27.

361
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,220
Um, it really hit my mental health then

362
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,520
it was kind of a delay.

363
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,619
And then I had to go to therapy,

364
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,560
um, for a long time.

365
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,500
I was put on suicide watch a couple

366
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,079
of times.

367
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:20,880
Wow.

368
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:23,690
Yeah.

369
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:26,089
It was, it was just bad, especially just

370
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:27,810
the not expecting it.

371
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,310
Haven't been so fine for so long.

372
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,170
Right.

373
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,470
And then just suddenly having a huge mental

374
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,650
breakdown and realizing that it was CPTSD and

375
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:42,950
now I'm, you know, bipolar, um, just from

376
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,550
all that, it all stems from that.

377
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,550
And it stems from my mom going away.

378
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:51,990
Um, yeah, stems from trying to tell people,

379
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,790
but not getting listened to.

380
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,110
Yeah.

381
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,570
Not being heard.

382
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,950
Um, all those things still impact me.

383
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,650
I still worry about not being listened to.

384
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,350
I still, you know, I still think about

385
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,130
all these things.

386
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,990
Um, but I have to, well, through therapy,

387
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,510
I learned how to rephrase the, the context

388
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,050
in my head.

389
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,250
Yes.

390
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,410
Reframing is amazing.

391
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,650
So this started at five and you're how

392
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,040
old now?

393
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,190
33.

394
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,510
33 and still healing.

395
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,730
So my advice to anyone, cause we, we

396
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,150
gotta go here in a second.

397
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,710
My advice, if I was going to give

398
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,370
someone advices, this is not something that you

399
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,450
can heal from immediately.

400
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,570
Um, look how, how, you know, how long

401
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,350
Brandon's been, been going at this.

402
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,710
Um, so don't, don't give up.

403
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,010
Uh, don't, don't give up.

404
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,350
Brandon, anything you want to say, piece of

405
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,130
advice, if you could.

406
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,250
Um, keep the healthy relationships.

407
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,530
Uh, like, you know, we all have, we

408
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,630
all know there's like two, three people in

409
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,990
your, in your life that probably put in

410
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,590
more effort than everybody else.

411
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,650
I mean, not everybody else is like mistreating

412
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,250
you or bad or whatever, but those, there's

413
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,850
two, three people that really make you have

414
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,290
fun and keep you positive.

415
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,870
They're, they're, those are the most important relationships

416
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,350
to absolutely the combating these kinds of issues.

417
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,370
Yeah.

418
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,490
You once said, live your life around your

419
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,310
mental health and not let your mental health

420
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,710
tell you how to live your life.

421
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,530
Something along those ways, that just kind of

422
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,990
sounded like what's his face on the moon,

423
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,830
but that's not what I was, it's not

424
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,630
what I was going for.

425
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,490
But you said it.

426
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,930
Build your life around, um, around your mental

427
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,570
health and your mental health issues and not

428
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,950
necessarily around what everybody expects you to do,

429
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:50,290
because, um, you know, once you're impacted by

430
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,110
these kinds of things, you're just not like

431
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,910
everybody else.

432
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,630
I mean, you can, you can still blend

433
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,130
into society and do all those things, but,

434
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,870
um, you still probably hiding, um, big aspects

435
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,330
of your problems, which, I mean, I don't

436
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,950
go around telling everybody that dealt with child

437
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,750
abuse and those things, but, you know, it's

438
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,650
not my, not my elevator pitch, but right.

439
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,590
You know, there's two, three people that you

440
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,950
tell, um, and talk to about those things.

441
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,010
It's just important.

442
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,810
Maybe next time or another episode could be

443
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,250
how to build your life around your mental

444
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,890
health versus letting it rule you because you're

445
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,670
actually doing that right now.

446
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,230
Um, and that would be awesome to talk

447
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,770
about and how that ties into making your

448
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,090
mental health better.

449
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:41,950
Um, so yeah.

450
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,590
Um, Brandon, thank you so much for joining

451
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,190
me today.

452
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,390
Um, I cannot wait until, you know, you

453
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,130
come back and we talk about, um, how

454
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,250
to build your life around mental health.

455
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,010
That's an awesome topic, but I'll have to

456
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,490
make it a musical name, but yeah.

457
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,330
Um, so yeah, thank you so much for

458
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,670
joining anything you want to say before we

459
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:01,870
go.

460
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,030
I don't know if that was all about,

461
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,470
um, toxic relationships or not.

462
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:06,870
I'm sorry.

463
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,830
Um, I kind of went down a tangent.

464
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,530
That's the whole point.

465
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:12,570
Organic.

466
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,350
No, no script organic, except for the definition

467
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,150
organic.

468
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:17,650
All right.

469
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,570
Thank you so much, Brandon.

470
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,410
Have a great day.

471
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,910
And I hope to see you next time.

472
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,910
Everybody join me again next week, and we

473
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,690
will talk about how to possibly maybe next

474
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,530
week, how to build your life around mental

475
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:28,790
health.

476
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,110
Um, have a great day, everybody.

477
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,210
Bye Brandon.
