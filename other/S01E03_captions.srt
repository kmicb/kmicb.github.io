00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,211
Hey, humans, thanks for joining my podcast.

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:09,050
This podcast is a place to share unedited lived experiences regarding mental health.

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,178
We'll touch on how it shows up in our lives and provide

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,474
some tips that have worked for me and others on how to manage it.

5
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,898
There will be strong language and definitely the

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,943
potential for disturbing and or triggering content.

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:30,280
Please be aware of this and mindful of

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,449
others who may be in earshot.

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,036
Most importantly, and as horribly fucking

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,206
cliche as this sounds, you really do not have to go through this alone.

11
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,961
And hopefully you'll see this and feel this more and more as you listen.

12
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:48,923
And hey, if this podcast isn't for you, that's fine.

13
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,176
There are lots of them out there.

14
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,471
Find one that speaks to you and helps you.

15
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,432
So, let's talk mental health.

16
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,460
And now the boiler plate and cover your ass claws

17
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:31,090

19
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,889
any way, and as such, no content on

20
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:41,893
this show is intended to be, whether implied or otherwise,

21
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,062

00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,429
Hello, everybody.

39
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,141
We are talking about building your life

40
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,727
around your mental health.

41
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,938
We touched briefly on it last week with Brandon here,

42
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,150
my guest, and I decided that

43
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,028
would be a great next episode.

44
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:20,116
I was thinking maybe doing a bonus or like a behind the scenes thing, but this is

45
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,453
neither because it

46
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,581
just ties into the topic mental health and

47
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,792
you know, how do we deal with it?

48
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,753
How do we live with it?

49
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,338
Most people fight it.

50
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,589
I've been fighting it decades

51
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,926
And I don't want to anymore.

52
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,928
I don't don't want to fight it.

53
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,721
I want to work with it.

54
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,680
It's clearly here to stay.

55
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,016
It has good days and bad days, but

56
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,771
I need to stop fighting it.

57
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,440
So, Brandon, welcome again.

58
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,442
Tell us.

59
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:02,992
how you got the idea of building your life around mental health.

60
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,994
Yeah, we'll just start there.

61
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,788
How'd you get that idea?

62
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,791
Like, what clicked or what made you think, oh, this isn't working anymore.

63
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,793
Let's try this.

64
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,712
Well, I wanted to live nomatically

65
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,215
for basically my entire adult life.

66
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,926
But when

67
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,305
when I had the second surgery, the second heart surgery

68
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:29,227
and all of that went down, I just, I couldn't ignore that impulse anymore.

69
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,023
It just, you know, it's time to be happier.

70
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,402
And then also the infection was super dangerous.

71
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,154
The whole reason I had the second surgery was that infection.

72
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,241
You brushed with death twice, survived.

73
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,245
And that's when you decided, I need to make some

74
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:51,416
changes because you're not happy and you need to live your life the way you want to.

75
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,418
Yeah.

76
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,295
So explain how you were living your life and then

77
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,800
we know what was the c was for the change.

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,178
So explain how or how you were living and

79
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,931
now how you are transitioning to where you want to be.

80
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:12,270
So before I've always had engineer type positions

81
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,064
NIT.

82
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,357
Yeah.

83
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,651
So I started out as a network engineer and

84
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:23,531
had a mental health collapse when that was going on.

85
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,533
So I switched to

86
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,953
a job that I thought I would like more in classroom design

87
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,206
and managing contractors and all of that.

88
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:37,420
But it still was I was just still struggling with it.

89
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,380
I don't really fit into the

90
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,467
the normal societal life where I have

91
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,553
this big long career because I don't know.

92
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,555
My mind's just not wired for that.

93
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:52,518
Tell just briefly what classroom design is so people know.

94
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:57,065
You work for a university, so let them know what classroom design means..

95
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,067
So I would

96
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:03,279
draw a blueprint or really have kind of blueprints for the room layout.

97
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,200
I would create wiring diagrams and then transpose those

98
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,746
that all that all the

99
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,374
wiring diagrams compassed onto the blueprints.

100
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,418
So the contractors install it.

101
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,379
And then I would

102
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,217
follow the project and make sure the contractors were doing it correctly.

103
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,677
I was also doing the scopes of work.

104
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:33,309
And this was all for setting up network infrastructure, audio audio video in a classroom?

105
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,687
This was when I was in the classroom technology.

106
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,690
Right.

107
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,234
So was it like a professor would say, hey, this classroom sucks.

108
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,236
I need this in here.

109
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,195
Or upgrgrades.

110
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,239
Usually it would be like the department.

111
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,449
Oh, okay.

112
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,158
Okay.

113
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,368
Or sometimes we were just doing mass upgrades and it was really

114
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,955
my decision and my supervisor's decision.

115
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,457
Okay..

116
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,334
So you were a network engineer and

117
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,963
then did not like switch to classroom design?

118
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,298
Don't really fit that.

119
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,175
Continue.

120
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,427
Yeah.

121
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,427
And I I found every time I got myself into a routine

122
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:13,474
like just like the normal routine, I would just fall apart.

123
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:20,189
Even if I like like getting up, getting dressed, going to work work, come home, rinse repeat.

124
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,442
Yeah.

125
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,569
So, I mean, even even though like at

126
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,447
the beginning of these jobs, I was really happy and exciting.

127
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,407
It just wore off.

128
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,827
And then I would lapse again.

129
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,121
I Yeah, I know that feeling.

130
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,081
Kind of like.

131
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,708
Like a honeymoon period.

132
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,626
Yeah.

133
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,295
What they would say, you know, relationships have that honeymoon phase.

134
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,297
Most every job I've worked

135
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,885
um, well, all, but I. Sorry.

136
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,972
All but one or two jobs were IT.T.

137
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,185
And I loved them all in the beginning.

138
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,020
Like it was fantastic.

139
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,189
And I don't know if it was just because, oh, new job, exciting.

140
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,691
Or if it's

141
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,694
new job exciting, great.

142
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,113
I love what I do, but then something, either the

143
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,992
people, the environment, or my mental health, it's no longer fun.

144
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:17,872
And then it becomes very, I get very irritated, very agitated.

145
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,918
You know, people are calling for help and the last thing I want to do is help them

146
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,713
And I don't know if

147
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:29,425
that's my mental health or

148
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,305
maybe those positions weren't for me, because

149
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,683
in general, I've never really liked to deal with the general public.

150
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,770
But as you, yeah, maybe.

151
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,357
But as you know, most IT people,

152
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:49,237
we start at the help desk when we get our foot in the door in this world.

153
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,197
And

154
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:51,739
that was fun.

155
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,282
I loved it because I love helping people.

156
00:08:55,826 --> 00:09:00,498
But it started to get irritating and

157
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:04,418
resentful that these people don't know how to do what they're calling me

158
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,630
to know how to do.

159
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,591
And my job is to help them do what they don't know how to do.

160
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,719
Sometimes you're just like, you know, Google's a thing.

161
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,930
Right.

162
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,806
Right.

163
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,557
But

164
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,058
right.

165
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:19,809
But that's what we're there for.

166
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,686
That's what the help desk is for.

167
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,229
You know, you don't, I don't, I don't.

168
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,774
I've had someone call me and ask where a bathroom was in

169
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,777
a building that I used to work at because they didn't know who else to call.

170
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,779
So they called the help desk.

171
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,698
I had some people.

172
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,740
I had somebody call and asking where to park

173
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,034
Yes.

174
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,703
Yeah, the IT help deskk.

175
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,955
One-stop shop.

176
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,125
It's like you're concierge, wherever you are.

177
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,461
Okay, so back where we were.

178
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,424
Engineer?

179
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,508
No.

180
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,175
Classroom tech, no.

181
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,177
Now you are

182
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,016
realizing you don't, it does doesn't fit you.

183
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,018
So continue for me.

184
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,229
So I just, I have all this

185
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,774
weird knowledge about IT and different aspects of

186
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:14,405
IT, you know, programming, networking, um, design and all that.

187
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,491
So I took all my experience and all

188
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:21,454
of my, my education and got a help desk job.

189
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,874
But I was able to find a part-time

190
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,293
one and it's a it's a remote position

191
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,171
Right now.

192
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:30,963
Yeah.

193
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,548
Which are the two things I wanted more most.

194
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,926
So I, yeah, I was happy to switch.

195
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,928
My doctor was happy.

196
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,013
I switched.

197
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,474
All in all, everybody is happier.

198
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,476
Yeah.

199
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,978
I. When I, when, when COVID

200
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:50,858
happened and we and most, a lot of people switched to working from home, I was so happy.

201
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,860
Yeah.

202
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,321
Most IT people, though, you know, we can work from home, depending

203
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,991
on what our job is, because we can just remote in and do what we need to do

204
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:02,953
I noticed

205
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,499
my mental health improved when I had to stop going

206
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,378
in and I could be in my own comfortable, safe environment

207
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:14,840
at home, wearing pretty much whatever I want from the waist down

208
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,135
just be careful when you stand up.

209
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,554
If you're on a virtual call, call people.

210
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,515
Yeah.

211
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:27,937
So my mental health, it improved because I'm someone I don't

212
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,815
uh, it's not a need.

213
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,693
I just don't, have, um, the ability

214
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:39,573
to be in someone's presence physically doesn't really exist with me.

215
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:43,619
Like, if I never saw another human in person

216
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,331
I, it wouldn't phase me.

217
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,376
Virtual is plenty for me.

218
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:54,839
If I can see you and we can chat and it's real time, that's enough. for me.

219
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,925
I don't I don't have to be in your presence to feel something.

220
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,138
But on the flip side, I have noticed when

221
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,307
I am physically around people, I do get a

222
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,685
little more of a boost in my mental health.

223
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,937
So it's a doubleged short.

224
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,856
It's like, I don't want to be around you people, but

225
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:16,110
because you annoy me and my mental health suffers.

226
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,656
But being around you helps my mental health a little bit.

227
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,909
So what the hell are you supposed to do when you don't want to be around

228
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,412
people, but you have to be around people?

229
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,206
It's.

230
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,458
Do what?

231
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,459
Answer phones.

232
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,127
Answer phones.

233
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,628
Yeah, yeah.

234
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,047
Okay, so you took all your skills, got this current job

235
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:40,009
working from home, and you like this better.

236
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,011
I I'm sure.

237
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:42,845
Oh, yeah.

238
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,512
Yeah.

239
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,055
I make a lot less money, but I'm also.

240
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,057
But you're happier.

241
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:47,892
I'm so much happier.

242
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,060
And I don't deal with the same levels of stress

243
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,565
Like my job is almost no stress.

244
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,777
I when I hang up the phone on somebody, it's over.

245
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,778
My part's done.

246
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:00,488
It goes on to next person.

247
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,449
Well, the problem's not sol.

248
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,950
I can do that.

249
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,912
I always had this horrible, horrible..

250
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:12,333
Actually, it's not a horrible thing to have, but follow through like, what they call follow through.

251
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,710
Even though I'm done, where where we?

252
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,921
See, that's what happens when I go off

253
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,298
on a tangent.

254
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,925
We work help us now.

255
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,594
You work I work help desk now, yes.

256
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,430
And from home and you noticed it is better for your mental health.

257
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,682
Why, though?

258
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,977
Like what, what aspect is better for your mental health?

259
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:37,149
Well, I don't have the stress or the pressure.

260
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:41,737
I I don't have to come in and do the same thing nearly every day.

261
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,032
I just kind of.

262
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,033
So it's not monotonous?

263
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,535
Your calls are different every time?

264
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:51,205
No, not really, but I only have to do it 20 hours a week.

265
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,457
Oh.

266
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,211
Yeah, it's just just not as main.

267
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,588
It's not the main focus of my life anymore.

268
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,216
I don't have to work a third of my days.

269
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,927
Yeah, working to live

270
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,221
or living to work.

271
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,472
I never get those right.

272
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:12,184
So yeah, I might make dozens of dollars, but I'm happier.

273
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,645
And that's the thing.

274
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,606
My, you know, I've had a job where I had

275
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,694
a very good salary, but I wasn't happy.

276
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:26,115
And then Lou said job, and

277
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,243
then some other things happen, and you go on this spiral.

278
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,453
But overall,

279
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,206
I'm happy.

280
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,585
Like, I don't.. not having the stress,

281
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:41,297
like, of something like that, the anxiety,

282
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,550
the horribleness that it does to

283
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,720
your body, the adrenaline dumps, the panic its attacks,

284
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,015
the tension, the sucking your tongue and holding

285
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:55,102
it to the roof of your mouth because you're so stressed out, grinding your teeth

286
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,981
gzing your hands, keeping your neck tense in your shoulders,

287
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,694
all of that is mental health manifested physically, all of it.

288
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,447
And some most people don't even realize they're doing it.

289
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,699
And staying tense like this

290
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:13,454
eight hours a day while you're working, not so good for the body.

291
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,206
Not so good at all.

292
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,625
Okay, so what are you doing then?

293
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,629
So, yeah, now I have a remote job. oil.

294
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,589
I only work part-time.

295
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,176
And now my partner and I are we're renovating

296
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,471
in our B, and we we're just going to live in it and travel.

297
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,932
Talk about that.

298
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:36,310
So yeah, that's actually one of the main reasons why I wanted a part-time

299
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:41,732
remote positions, because I don't know, I've always been drawn to a nomadic lifestyle.

300
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:47,780
Really, I think it has hard to do with like my trauma and then part to do with

301
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,240
being bipolar.

302
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,993
I just don't quite

303
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,956
survive well into regular societal life.

304
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,043
So yeah, now we're working on the RV.

305
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:05,714
I'm way more excited for the future.

306
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,134
I don't picture myself in five

307
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,888
years doing the same thing and being stressed out.

308
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,848
So that's been great.

309
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,852
So you actually have a vision of the future that's no

310
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,230
longer stressful or anxious.

311
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,691
Exactly.

312
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,693
It's just, yeah, it's just exciting.

313
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,779
So when you say a nomadic lifestyle,

314
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,281
you talk more about that.

315
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,493
Like, you're not just going to up and move into an RV and

316
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,746
then just travel the country and never, I guess,

317
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,165
have like a quote unquote home base or something.

318
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,627
You still plan to have like, you know, home base.

319
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:48,090
If we're going to have a home base, I don't know how often we'll be here.

320
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,219
But in America, being

321
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,930
homeless is apparently a bad option.

322
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,182
Being un housed, yeah.

323
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,437
They get mad.

324
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,190
It's best to have a physical address somewhere.

325
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,526
Right.

326
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,695
Because society doesn't like nomads.

327
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,655
You know, we're

328
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,492
So you have an RV that

329
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,955
you purchased a used one, and you gutted it, right?

330
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,915
Inside.

331
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,376
And I know you just told me you did,

332
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,588
you had to rewire the wiring harness for the engine because you

333
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,923
put, well, you tell, you talk about it.

334
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:33,469
Walk us through what you did from buying me in until right now.

335
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,180
So we bought it.

336
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,766
We wanted a something not normal, something cool.

337
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:42,227
So we bought a a 1972 RV.

338
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,521
So it's got, it's really cute.

339
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:49,443
It's got all kinds of character, but it also gets like four miles to now.

340
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,821
The thing that thing is never met a gas station.

341
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,782
It doesn't like.

342
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,657
Is it gas or diesel?

343
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,201
Yes.

344
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,035
G. It's a big block.

345
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:00,496
Have you thought about converting it?

346
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,956
To diesel?

347
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,541
Well, not straight diesel.

348
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,712
Like the hybrid one where you can just go get like

349
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,674
french fry oil and, you know, obviously strain and filter.

350
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,676
Yeah, you can clean, but I met something like that.

351
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,261
You have to do.

352
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,137
You have to have a diesel to do that.

353
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,555
Oh, you have.

354
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:22,267
But what I am doing, I took a, I got an engine out of a

355
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:26,480
just a Chevy, 2500, and I'm really builtbuilding it.

356
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,609
And I'm just going to do an engine swap with

357
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,487
a modern engine and get g injection and cruise control.

358
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,199
All of the nice things, a check engine light.

359
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:41,703
That light that's always on no matter how new your car is.

360
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,790
And then maybe get nine to 11 miles down.

361
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,750
Maybe.

362
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,502
What?

363
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,922
I can't even scroll back in the captions.

364
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,259
I really don't like these captions.

365
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,928
But I that's how I...

366
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,140
Oh, someone asked, how do you do a podcast through your death?

367
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:05,018
Well, I do have some residual hearing, so this

368
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,147
monitors I have on my ears are jacked up to 10.

369
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:11,108
They' as loud as they go.

370
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,402
Plus, I have my hearing aids under these.

371
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,612
So it's also being amplified.

372
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,614
So that's how I do it.

373
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,949
And then I rely on the captions on the screen.

374
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,411
So any of my guests who don't speak slowly or clearly

375
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,788
No.

376
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,082
No, it's doing good with you, Brandon.

377
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,668
It typically does good with you, but I have some friends that call.

378
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,380
It just doesn't, it doesn't do well, which makes it impossible.

379
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,968
Anyhow, so you got an engine, Chevy.

380
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,970
You put it in here.

381
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,013
You redid the harness.

382
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,681
You said you're going to do aftermarket stuff

383
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,434
You said you mentioned one of them, cruise control.

384
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,477
Yeah.

385
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,980
So the engine I have is all electronically controlled.

386
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,066
So the throttle the throttle controlled.

387
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,027
Fly by wire?

388
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,194
Let's drive by wire.

389
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,946
So

390
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,700
it's really easy to make those things work.

391
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,202
Right.

392
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:06,246
I mean, you know, as well as I do in the tech field,

393
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:10,709
adding more complexity to something makes it even worse when it breaks.

394
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:16,214
So did this, this engine has ODB2 connection, right?

395
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,425
Yeah.

396
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,051
Or is it OBD2?

397
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,219
I don't, you know what I mean.

398
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,303
So it does.

399
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,638
Okay.

400
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,305
Okay.

401
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:23,972
So.

402
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:28,810
I just have I just have a microphone slashcamera, potato combination.

403
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,812
Potato combination

404
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,191
Okay.

405
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,734
So what are your plans?

406
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,947
Do you have a date, like a rollout date, where wheels up, we're out?

407
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,699
Wheels.

408
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,368
Not specifically.

409
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,911
We're hoping to get it done before winter.

410
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,913
You know winter's here, right?

411
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,623
It just snowed yesterday

412
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:53,001
Yeah, but we we didn't originally plan to gut it all at once.

413
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:56,171
We were just going to do the bedroom and then do the rest of overtime.

414
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,423
Oh.

415
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,258
But

416
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:03,345
we found mice nest or a rat nest.

417
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,305
So we're just like, well, we'll just gut it.

418
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,474
Yeah.

419
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:11,061
And I'm I'm really glad we did because there there was a lot, there was a lot more.

420
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,438
Found some things you didn't know were going to be there.

421
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,024
Yeah.

422
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,694
That's the way it goes when you're working on something that's over 50 years old.

423
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,406
Hell, working on anything nowadays,

424
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,784
you'll find things that you did not expect to be in there and

425
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,036
that most times shouldn't be in there.

426
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:33,917
So is your plan, like, you don't really have a plan.

427
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,878
You're just going to go do you?

428
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,839
Or just drive the country?

429
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,717
Do you have a route or are you just going to go south, north,heast, west, whatever.

430
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,970
That's why it fits into me.

431
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,930
No plan.

432
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,639
Just go and see what happens.

433
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,059
My manic episodes can now just be, hey, let's go to this city.

434
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,061
That is so appealing to me.

435
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,980
Like,

436
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,691
and you'll still be able to work, right?

437
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,359
Remotely with.

438
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,945
Yeah, I'll have a Well, we have the TMobile

439
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:07,284
5G. And we can just take it where we go and I can

440
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,203
I can answer calls.

441
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,955
It's not glamorous, but I can answer calls.

442
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,709
I know quite a few people who in IT work

443
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:19,421
remotely, who are a nomadic lifestyle.

444
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,883
They you know, they have a home or they have a condo or something,

445
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,053
but they prefer to spend the majority of their time traveling.

446
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:29,181
Yeah. you meet new people

447
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,266
and you get away from people you don't like

448
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:35,020
And that's how you find more like-minded people is

449
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,981
you get out and you socialize, which..

450
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,983
What?

451
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,486
I More than forward to being able to tell the people who call

452
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:47,949
me for tech support, my personal life, being like, you know, I'm in California.

453
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,951
I don't want to tell you.

454
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:50,827
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

455
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,454
So we don't have that problem here in California.

456
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,456
Sorry

457
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,165
Let me give you another number to call.

458
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,958
His name is.

459
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:57,959
Just kidding.

460
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:02,923
You know where I was going with that.

461
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,675
A little inside Joe. Can't share that.

462
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:09,054
I do that to the IT telemarketers that call my office phone.

463
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,056
I send them that way.

464
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:11,973
Perfect.

465
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:12,933
Perfect.

466
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,686
So So, yeah, that, that sounds appealing.

467
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,106
I know there's other people out there that sounds appealing.

468
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,775
And I'm sure there are people out there who think, I can't do that.

469
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,944
I can't do that at this stage in my life.

470
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,947
I'm too young or I'm too old or, well, I

471
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,074
have this or I don't have enough money or

472
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,744
walk us through this

473
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,248
because, I mean, let's be honest, you're not rich.

474
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,250
I know you.

475
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,918
You're not even close to rich.

476
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,170
Dozens of dollars.

477
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,172
Dozens of dollars.

478
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,549
Right, right.

479
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,341
I mean, it costs more to

480
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,970
file the taxes in an envelope than it does does to get back.

481
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,681
Dozens of dollars.

482
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,434
What's your plan?

483
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,936
Do you have a plan for like income.

484
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,730
You know, you got so you have your gas for the vehicle.

485
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,732
You have insurance for the vehicle.

486
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,943
You have whatever maintenance comes up.

487
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,029
You have, you know, which is brakes, tires, oil,

488
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,198
transmission fluid, belts

489
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,952
um serpentine, you know, all these different expenses

490
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,958
and you're in a, what, 30-some year old RV?

491
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,712
52 Oh, sorry.

492
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,714
What year is it?

493
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,424
1972.

494
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,633
72.

495
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,885
Okay, okay.

496
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,889
Yeah, so you have this old piece of ancient history that

497
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,267
knock on wood could just fail at any moment.

498
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,269
Do you have any plans for that?

499
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,855
Like, I think, I feel like it would be a fun, cool thing, but like,

500
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,065
what if it just breaks down, right?

501
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,985
You blow a hose or something and you, you, it's no big deal.

502
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,987
You don't need to find a hotel.

503
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,197
You live in it

504
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,951
Yeah, in most car issues, I can I can fix myself.

505
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:59,080
Because I've been working on cars just about my whole life.

506
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,125
Which is another plus is having the

507
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,671
automotive electronic experience, the

508
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:10,091
IT experience, all of that, mechanic experience experience is great

509
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,219
for people who want to live on the road.

510
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:17,641
For people who don't have those skill sets, but still

511
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,561
want this nomadic life, well,

512
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,898
like my partner, she is

513
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:30,487
really into art and crocheting and those kinds of things.

514
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:35,534
So what we're going to do with what she wants to do is start

515
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,995
a a web store to

516
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,957
complement her, because she goes to markets now.

517
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,502
She's to compliment the market, she wants to start a YouTube channel

518
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,964
and link her store to that so she

519
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,967
can start selling her work to more people.

520
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,929
So that's her plan.

521
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,224
And then my plan is I, you know, I got this remote position.

522
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,226
I can keep doing it.

523
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,435
Right.

524
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:02,852
And I'm also

525
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,980
able to do finished carpentry.

526
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:08,525
So I I

527
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,902
like to restore furniture and stuff and flip it.

528
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,946
And then every once in a while I'll take a commission job.

529
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,699
So are you going to have like a

530
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:20,412
a website for yourself or for your

531
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,915
brand of nomadic lifestyle so that like when you go places, you can

532
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,209
set up side jobs to make a little money, right?

533
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,670
Yeah, yeah, we can do that.

534
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,757
I hadn't figured out the specifics on that part.

535
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,759
For now, I'm just going to

536
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:39,597
just lean on my current, just my

537
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,643
shore income.

538
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,603
Right, right, right, right, right.

539
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,897
And then I also had a nest egg.

540
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,899
Okay.

541
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,693
Well, that's always good.

542
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,696
Do you have any advice?

543
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:58,700
We're not leaving, but do you have any advice for people who don't have these skill sets but still want this wife?

544
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,952
Like someone who's like, oh, God, what if it breaks down?

545
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,663
What if this happens to my, I don't know anything about this.

546
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,665
What do I do?

547
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:06,249
Any advice for people like that?

548
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,961
I mean, just, just look for something that

549
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:13,506
you can do remotely or, or

550
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:17,552
find a hobby that you really like and and find a way to monetize it.

551
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,512
No, no, no.

552
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,848
I mean people who are committed to doing this nomadic

553
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,769
lifestyle and traveling in an RV or converted bus or whatever they decide

554
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,481
But they have no mechanical skills.

555
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,192
They have nothing like that, like nothing.

556
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,944
But they still want to do this.

557
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:39,366
There's a lot of people in the van life community that have that problem.

558
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,744
not a problem.

559
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,120
It's just don't have that dealset.

560
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,081
Yeah.

561
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:46,581
Yeah.

562
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,207
It's a problem that breaks down.

563
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,209
Right.

564
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,126
Can be, yeah.

565
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,296
But they usually go and find like a

566
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,508
a little bit newer of a vehicle.

567
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,428
Okay, so you would recommend some newer.

568
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,933
And then they also, you know, There's

569
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,227
always mom and pop mechanics.

570
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,688
What about insurance?

571
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,358
Is it, you know, I need to talk to you about your expired car warranty.

572
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,778
Well, with

573
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,948
an RV, you can ensure it as an RV,

574
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,701
which is a good amount cheaper.

575
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:28,998
Does it cover everything inside of it, or do you need renter's insurance?

576
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:33,169
Like, I don't or like, how do you call owners insurance an RV?

577
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,464
I think it just depends on the insurance plan.

578
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,466
Okay.

579
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,594
For us if we had it like

580
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,055
burned to the ground for whatever reason.

581
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,099
Knock on wood, not putting that out.

582
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,059
I think we would probably just lose what's in it.

583
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,187
But, you know, it's just stuff.

584
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,190
Fair.

585
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,150
It is just stuff.

586
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,317
As long as the animals got out.

587
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,278
And you guys.

588
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,195
Yeah.

589
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,029
Yeah.

590
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:00,447
Yeah.

591
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:00,780
That's move. important.

592
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,992
So you don't have, you you

593
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,744
don't have any plans or like a set.

594
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:09,831
Like, I want to go see the biggest ball with yarn or I want to go see the world's

595
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,667
largest frying pan because that's something I would do.

596
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,919
I would go travel to all those places

597
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,758
We'll probably go to those places, but it'll just be, you know, whenever we want.

598
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,759
Spontaneous, sporadic.

599
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,428
Mostly.

600
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,930
It's probably depend on what's making me manic at that moment.

601
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,433
That's fair.

602
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,436
And that full circle now, now we can go back into this.

603
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,231
Wving your wife your life around around your mental health.

604
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,984
So how often do you think you get manic?

605
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,195
Or how often do you know you get manic?

606
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,071
Sorry, not think?

607
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,198
Every

608
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,453
Probably around six to eight weeks.

609
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,206
Sometimes a little more than that.

610
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,708
Out of a year or at once, consecutively.

611
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,169
Oh, just

612
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,921
between.

613
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,380
Yeah, I think that was an underestimate now.

614
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,467
But did you mean that, like, total in

615
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,887
a year, you get manic about total time, six to eight weeks,

616
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,598
or do you mean you stay manic for six to eight?

617
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,558
weeks?

618
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,645
Well, I was thinking about it, and I get

619
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:19,192
manic probably four weeks from the last time ends.

620
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,444
So time.

621
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:26,783
So, like, let's say I have a manic episode that's two weeks long.

622
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,869
I'll probably skip out until

623
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,955
another four weeks after that..

624
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,707
So it's like six weeks that way.

625
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,462
So you have manic episodes that last two weeks, up to two weeks?

626
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,173
Sometimes.

627
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,675
Whoa.

628
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,426
Oh, I've lost thousands

629
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,470
of dollars to manicica.

630
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:51,015
Wow, and that's very common, too.

631
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,017
The people

632
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,186
captions said mannequin.

633
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,980
Good Lord.

634
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:02,652
Yeah, I think I added it up in my head earlier,

635
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,989
and I've lost about probably at least 20 grand.

636
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,950
In the span of what time?

637
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:14,205
Since I was, I think around 25.

638
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,708
25?

639
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,459
So 7 years years?

640
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,420
No.

641
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:20,962
Eight years?

642
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:21,921
Getting old.

643
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,507
Right.

644
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,508
Eight years.

645
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:29,762
So what is what does mania look like for you?

646
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,806
Is it the same every time?

647
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,808
Or is it.

648
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,519
Sometimes I like one time I went on a minimal minimalist

649
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,981
kick and I threw just about all my belongings away

650
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,693
And that went well.

651
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,946
Did it?

652
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,906
Did it go well?

653
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:51,159
And then, I mean, I bought, I purchased like

654
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:56,414
so many project vehicles during manic episodes.

655
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,708
There's only one of them I don't regret.

656
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,044
And that's, that's the Jeep.

657
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,545
The Jeep.

658
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,129
I knew you were going to say The Jeep.

659
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,424
The Jeep.

660
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,675
Yeah.

661
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,218
The one manic episode that paid off in the longer end.

662
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,181
Wow.

663
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:13,264
So is it.

664
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,559
Is it kind of like a retail therapy when you're manic?

665
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,729
Or do you do retail therapy even when you're not manic?

666
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,649
It's not really retail therapy.

667
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,735
I get obsessed with like a certain thing or

668
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,196
a certain hobby or a certain.

669
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,199
And I

670
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,535
I just go all in and then I want to get the best

671
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:38,706
of the best and I buy it, and then I use it for like a week.

672
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,085
Or I stay excited about it for a week.

673
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,045
Right.

674
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,507
And that's once again, at my hand, it's like, oh, yeah, who cares?

675
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,509
Do what?

676
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,301
And that's the mania for you?

677
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,471
Sometimes, sometimes I just go like on a

678
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,849
crazy cleaning spree where I'll pull everything

679
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,394
out of the drawers and organize everything.

680
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,396
And

681
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,730
it really.

682
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,439
And you would.

683
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,316
I'm sorry, it depends.

684
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,276
And you attribute this to

685
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:13,950
Manic episodes, the bipolar, and not, say, ADHD or autism?

686
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:17,245
Or a combination of all three.

687
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,247
My therapist thinks it's

688
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,584
from bipolar, but also like CPTSD

689
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,962
has very similar symptoms.

690
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,423
Avo.

691
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,176
And then I'm just kind of realizing here recently,

692
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,637
enough people have mentioned it to me.

693
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,723
I didn't realize I might be autistic.

694
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,644
See, everybody else seems to know.

695
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,647
I mean, everyone else seemed to know about me as

696
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,358
well until, you know, a diagnosis.

697
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,403
Yeah, you're so autistic, Brandon.

698
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,239
You are like hardcore.

699
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,872
A lot of people I know are, and it's funny that the people, like you say, keep good people in your life.

700
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,958
Those are the good people that are in my life,

701
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,211
the ones that kind of think like me or at the very least

702
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,922
understand how I think..

703
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:13,384
And you, you said that., I think I just said that keep

704
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,511
the people, the good people in your life.

705
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,306
Yeah, you know, the people who bring positivity

706
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,933
Right.

707
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,186
And that you can confide in.

708
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,938
Right.

709
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,732
Someone you can trust and that you can, right, right, right, right.

710
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:31,402
And I was actually talking today, like, when is

711
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:36,699
talking about something become complaining about something?

712
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,660
And as an example, I was talking about this morning

713
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:44,957
we were talking about hearing and how there are some days

714
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,711
like today, you know, I just

715
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,048
cried most of today because I was

716
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,134
trying to listen to some music and I was then I was

717
00:34:55,176 --> 00:35:00,223
going to try to work on a song on, well, a few songs I was composing before all this fun shit happened.

718
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,975
But it doesn't sound the same to me.

719
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,685
It's not.

720
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,356
It's just not the same.

721
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,108
And most days, I'm just like, oh, well, I mean, this is it.

722
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,110
Radical acceptance, right?

723
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,278
This is your life now.

724
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:18,324
But then there are some days like today where I can't block, you know, the thoughts.

725
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,284
Yeah.

726
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,203
And I just, what can you do?

727
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,788
Right?

728
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,038
So I just go with it.

729
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,081
I'm not fighting it anymore.

730
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,499
So I just sat here and cried.

731
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,959
That's all I did.

732
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,211
We sat right here in this chair and fucking cried.

733
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:35,883
Um, with music blasting in my monitors and my hearing aids trying to

734
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:41,681
get back a feeling of the times when it was like normal, so to speak.

735
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,644
Yeah, so we were talking about that.

736
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,604
And I'm like...

737
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,525
Who do I talk to this about?

738
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,443
Everyone I know already knows.

739
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,404
Like everyone I know knows about this.

740
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,198
So if I talk about it every day to get it off my

741
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,993
chest, when is it complaining?

742
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:05,079
And like, I'm always afraid someone's going to be like, oh, there's Christopher.

743
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,039
He's complaining again.

744
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:07,623
And about, you know, he's hearing.

745
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,502
I would say complaining starts when you

746
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:15,214
have control over the situation, or

747
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,216
at least some control over the situation.

748
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,427
In my own.

749
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,428
Explain that.

750
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,430
So, like, you're hearing loss.

751
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,432
You have no control over that.

752
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,434
There's nothing you can do about it.

753
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,436
It's just a huge impact on your life right now.

754
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,688
And in the future

755
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,939
I mean.

756
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,192
As a classical piano for 40 years, yeah.

757
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:39,280
I mean, I would expect you to be upset and I wouldn't classify that as complaining.

758
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,449
It's so much more than than upset, Brandon.

759
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,701
Yeah, well, I know.

760
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,453
It's, it's like,

761
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,456
There are no words.

762
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,125
I can't find a word to mean how I feel.

763
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,210
But I I mean, it ruins your life.

764
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,380
The way you are with music.

765
00:36:56,422 --> 00:37:00,176
It just, it ruins what you mean as life.

766
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:05,014
My identity for 40 years was piano, piano, piano, piano, piano, piano, piano, piano

767
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,893
And that's why I wouldn't classify it as

768
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:12,772
a complaint as more of it's like like a

769
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,191
huge issue you're dealing dealing with.

770
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,194
But how do you talk to this do you talk

771
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:20,988
about this so that you're getting it out?

772
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:27,203
because it affects you every day, every second that I'm awayake.

773
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,164
How do you get this out and process

774
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:34,377
it without sounding like you're just complaining about

775
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,504
the same thing over and over again?

776
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,173
Because, right, it's always going to be about the same thing that's

777
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,176
consuming.

778
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,805
It's why there's two or three people are important because

779
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:50,101
like if you talk to me about it, I'm never going to think to just complainingaining.

780
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,103
It's, you.

781
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,021
Yeah.

782
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,189
It's huge.

783
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,191
It is.

784
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:00,152
And when I'm told to talk about it, I

785
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:03,239
don't know what to talk about, if that makes sense.

786
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,158
Like, I don't, like, what do I say?

787
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:09,495
Okay, mers, the tinitis is so loud.

788
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,497
I can't really hear anything else.

789
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:15,084
Then it drops again, and then I had to get new hearing

790
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:18,796
aids, and now music is like not even existing in my life anymore.

791
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:22,675
What do you say and to talk about it when people already know?

792
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:26,053
I mean, and that, anything mental health that

793
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:29,724
somebody may know about you, how do you talk about it without it

794
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,935
coming off that you're just complaining?

795
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,689
It's really a great area.

796
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,399
It's hard.

797
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,736
And Don Yars even said it today,

798
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,947
it depends on the person you're talking to.

799
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,657
You know, if they're taking it that way.

800
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,909
He's like, it just depends.

801
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,954
And you can't really, you can't control how someone takes something.

802
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:56,417
You can clarify before you say something, like pre

803
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,378
or you can clarify after you say something.

804
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:04,216
But in that moment, there's no way someone's just going to perceive what they perceive.

805
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,803
Yeah, and like when I have some

806
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,223
kind of trigger, well, triggers a strong word.

807
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,225
When I have something that really

808
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:17,938
makes me remember things from my past that were challenging.

809
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:22,526
I mean, my response to that, I don't think would be a complaint.

810
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,487
It would just be

811
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:28,699
something that I like, I don't have a lot of control over how I feel.

812
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:34,955
I mean, we do, but also there's there's circumstances that we have no control over.

813
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,458
Right.

814
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,501
That's where radical acceptance comes into play.

815
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:42,671
You started to say trigger and then said, no, why did you change it?

816
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,424
Well, I don't..

817
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,928
I feel like trigger is something..

818
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:52,348
I don't know.

819
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:52,765
I like I don't like the.

820
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,559
I guess I don't enjoy or I don't like

821
00:39:56,477 --> 00:40:00,689
the concept of triggers.

822
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:04,151
I feel like that puts a taboo on some things.

823
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:08,656
You know, if you're going to get emotional, it's going to happen.

824
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:12,076
If you don't want to be emotional, then I don't know.

825
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,078
But

826
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,372
Well, I think in the context of mental health, trigger means

827
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:22,461
a specific thing that breaks up a traumatic.

828
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,881
I guess the way I think about it is that

829
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:30,302
I don't mind triggers because it makes me communicate

830
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,471
things and de-stigmatize things

831
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,932
from my past.

832
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,768
I don't, I feel like there's a stigma in

833
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:42,189
being a victim a lot of times in cases of abuse and such like that.

834
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:49,363
And I just, I just don't like people walking on the eggs shoulders around me.

835
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,323
If it happens, it happens kind of thing.

836
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,284
So I guess they could still be considered triggers.

837
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:56,287
I just don't I don't view it as a

838
00:40:56,328 --> 00:41:00,374
thing to hold me down or view it as a thing that I get to communicate to people

839
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,169
Right.

840
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,754
That's a good way of reframing that.

841
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,756
Wow.

842
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,509
Hmm.

843
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,678
Yeah, I still call them triggers.

844
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,185
But I never really put it any thought into the actual word.

845
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:24,064
I guess I see triggers and opportunities.

846
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,066
Right.

847
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:28,444
Okay.

848
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,779
Triggers as opportunities.

849
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,075
Yeah, when I, something triggers and I have a panic

850
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:40,206
attack, first thing I think of is not, oh, here's an opportunity to figure out what happened.

851
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:44,168
Nope, that's not what happens when you have a panic attack, unfortunately

852
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,171
But that's interesting.

853
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:52,468
A trigger has a room for room to whatever you said.

854
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,678
It's a room for

855
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,473
it's room for understanding..

856
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:59,475
Okay.

857
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,227
You know, it's like you're going to have a

858
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,813
visceral visceral reaction oftentimes with

859
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,066
a trigger, but I don't know.

860
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,026
I just don't view that as

861
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,445
a thing I want to avoid.

862
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,905
I view it as a thing that I want to..

863
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,491
Oh, yeah, yeah.

864
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,033
No way. portray

865
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,538
Right.

866
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,415
It's you want to work through them because

867
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:27,836
you want to identify them so that they don't become triggers anymore.

868
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,797
Yeah.

869
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,218
It's complicated.

870
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,302
I mean.

871
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:35,678
It is.

872
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,136
No, it is.

873
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,597
I mean, some people avoid trigers like to play.

874
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,599
Right.

875
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,559
I just want people to be just to be around me.

876
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,520
I don't want or like to be themselves.

877
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,022
And I don't want them to walk on eggshells because they might

878
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,275
trigger me.

879
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,026
Well, but that's part of life.

880
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:54,196
Like, we can't tell everyone we know, hey, these are my triggers.

881
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,741
And you can't tell everyone you interact with that.

882
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:02,204
Maybe you're close or a friend, you know, those people you were talking about.

883
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:06,333
But once you get really good at reframing things in your mind

884
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,420
triggers become different, I guess.

885
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,422
No, no, no.

886
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,631
Yeah.

887
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:12,923
Yeah.

888
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,467
I never thought about reframing a trigger once

889
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:20,472
you identify it to help lessen it and make it not a trigger anymore.

890
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,474
Never thought about that.

891
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,059
Because I do.

892
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:24,727
I have learned to read.

893
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,103
I'm sorry, what?

894
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,105
It could still be a trigger, but it trigger

895
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,107
a different response.

896
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,109
Right.

897
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,570
The analogy I use, I don't know why.

898
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:38,240
because you can physically rewire your brain.

899
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,161
You can make new new pathways and CBT

900
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,080
DBT.

901
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,251
I mean, I haven't done that before, so it's, yeah,

902
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:52,046
that's what I've been doing for decades.

903
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:56,717
The analogy I use is when I had a trigger

904
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:02,306
um, you know, I'm, I'm I'm in a car.

905
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,809
I'm driving down the interstate freeway, whatever you want.

906
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,811
I'm on the 405, okay?

907
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,396
I'm in I'm in LA County.

908
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,814
I'm driving on the 405.

909
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:14,693
Something triggers me.

910
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,197
I figure out what the trigger is.

911
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:26,705
I love when I lose my train of thought right in the middle of a good fucking sentence.

912
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,209
Going down there.

913
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,043
What are you just talking about.

914
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,920
Going down the 405, something triggers you.

915
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,758
Right, but before that, I need to get led back into what I was thinking, and I can't scroll in the captions.

916
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,718
Thank you, Zoom

917
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:40,886
So..

918
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,221
I think.

919
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,932
What were we talking about?

920
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:45,933
Is a problem?

921
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:46,892
We both do this.

922
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:47,726
I know.

923
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:48,477
We were talking about triggers.

924
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,648
Going on the road on the 405.

925
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,608
Oh, yes, my analogy.

926
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,611
So I have a trigger trigger triggers me in the past.

927
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,613
I would immediately take the exit.

928
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,281
That's my exit.

929
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,241
Here's the trigger.

930
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:02,950
Here's the trauma.

931
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:03,659
Here's my exit.

932
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:04,451
This is familiar.

933
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,285
This is what I'm used to.

934
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,370
I'm here now.

935
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,538
Yay

936
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,457
What happens now, the

937
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:14,420
ones that I have identified, I'll be driving down the 405.

938
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,047
Oh, oh, look, there's that exit.

939
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,717
Yeah, that was a fucking horrible time.

940
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,469
And then I just keep driving, drive right past it.

941
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,682
I think it is important to know for

942
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:31,145
me, I don't know if this is everybody, for me, even

943
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:35,190
after you learn the trigger, even after you have worked through it

944
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:40,696
and have created that new pathway, the trigger is still there.

945
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,198
Yeah.

946
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,074
Oh, no, the only can be there.

947
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,034
Right.

948
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:46,535
The memory is there.

949
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,328
It's always going to be there.

950
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,289
And, and

951
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,751
maybe that might be what confuses or turns people away

952
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:57,045
is when they hear, you know, oh, you'll heal.

953
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,006
You'll get through this and you'll just heal.

954
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,341
You might get better.

955
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:04,219
You might, you might, you might not.

956
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,181
But that memory is never going to go

957
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:10,601
away, but how you react to it is what changes.

958
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,728
So I'm driving down this the 405

959
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:15,230
trigger, gross.

960
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,441
Well, I have a new pathway in my head.

961
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:21,653
Okay, well, that happened, but it doesn't really bother me anymore because that was forever ago.

962
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,614
Keep driving.

963
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,948
Right path.

964
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:29,661
I've heard a metaphor from a couple from a YouTuber, I've really used to follow a lot

965
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,207
So like things in your past are like

966
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:37,961
like a scar on a tree, like if you carve your name into it or whatever.

967
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,423
Those things, they're not going to get smaller.

968
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,301
They're going to stay in about the same place

969
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,888
and the same size, but the tree will get bigger.

970
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,890
Right.

971
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,517
So, like, they might seem big, but

972
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,686
as you grow, those things are the

973
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:59,191
same size of smaller compared to your life experiences.

974
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,194
That's a good analogy.

975
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,659
Okay, so you herd a tree and you carve

976
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,702
your name, you carve something into it.

977
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,207
The tree is just going to grow straight up.

978
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:19,211
Yeah, and that thing is going to stay in roughly the same spot.

979
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:23,840
Well, I mean, it's going to grow with it, right?

980
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,801
Won't it move up as the tree grows?

981
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:30,305
I guess depending on the age of the tree and where you put it, sure, that place into this, I guess

982
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,767
But yeah, I mean, if it's an established tree,

983
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,936
yes, it's just going to pretty much stay where it is.

984
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:40,440
But the tree evolves and gets bigger and gets stronger,

985
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:44,111
you know, better footing, reach for that light.

986
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:47,197
And then, boom, beautiful, strong tree.

987
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:52,953
That metaphor

988
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:56,873
just really has helped me in a lot of a lot of saying it.

989
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,209
It's just a helpful metaphor for my mental health.

990
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,671
And what do you do, visualize it?

991
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,591
Like, does something pop in your head and you're like, oh, I need to let me

992
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:08,135
ground real quick and go, you fall back on that?

993
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,512
It's not really a visualized thing.

994
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:15,142
It's more, it is a grounding thing, but it's just a remembering

995
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,687
Just.

996
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,813
Be mindful.

997
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,940
I mean, I hate that word, but Jesus, yeah, just being mindful.

998
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:25,235
In the in the moment, in the present.

999
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:32,242
Okay, so you get manic for a week or two.

1000
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,202
You're out on the road.

1001
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,665
Are you worried about your nest egg and

1002
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,918
manic draining your bank account?

1003
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,671
I won't.

1004
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,049
It won't be as easy for me because I won't be able to

1005
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,719
just buy things in California and have a place to put them.

1006
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,181
Oh, that's fair, because now that you're..

1007
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,934
Oh, I didn't even think about that.

1008
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:00,896
Things you start collecting a lot. along the way, you're going to need to drop off somewhere.

1009
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:06,234
And if I' if I'm in like California or somewhere, anywhere out west,

1010
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:12,199
or even anywhere on the East Coast, it's it's just not a really good deal on a Jeep.

1011
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,202
I'll have to pass it.

1012
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,748
Or tow it behind you and convert it as an

1013
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,168
add-on bedroom to your RV.

1014
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,963
I think Dell's going to need to have a word with you.

1015
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,049
Why?

1016
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,219
Why would she have to have a word with me?

1017
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,429
You might be encouraging.

1018
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,724
Is it the bad things that I do?

1019
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,769
I mean, I guess not bad, but...

1020
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,146
Yeah, when people have..

1021
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,898
What?

1022
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:45,148
I think it's called enabling?

1023
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,942
Enabling, yes.

1024
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,361
And it's, it can be dangerous when you have other friends with similar

1025
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:52,239
mental health because you guys can feed off each other.

1026
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,199
That is a thing.

1027
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:59,496
And if you're ever manic and you're happy, like if I see you happy and you're like, should I buy this?

1028
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,456
I'm going to be like, fuck yeah, you should.

1029
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,458
It's going to make you happy.

1030
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,626
I don't know your manic.

1031
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,878
Yeah.

1032
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:07,587
I don't even know.

1033
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,673
And that's the thing, too.

1034
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,842
Sometimes you don't know your manic.

1035
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:15,595
Do you have anything that you know that

1036
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,723
helps you be like, oh, fuck, a manic?

1037
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:22,185
How do you know you were manic for a week or two?

1038
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:26,940
Once I start looking at big purchases, I really should like a little red flag.

1039
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:31,194
So it's checking the bank statement, you're like, fuck, I was manic.

1040
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,697
Yeah.

1041
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,698
So I've started

1042
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,201
here lately, or at least I'm trying to,

1043
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:41,872
if I am looking into something for more more than

1044
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,207
like a month or two,

1045
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:49,421
if I'm not doing that, it's probably a manic episode.

1046
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,466
But if I've thought it out and I have all this idea, this

1047
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,844
idea, and I've been really excited about it for

1048
00:50:55,886 --> 00:51:01,516
a couple months, it's likely, likely not a manic episode.

1049
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,518
But when I see

1050
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:06,188
when I see like a box truck for $2,000 and

1051
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:10,108
I'm like, I have to buy this and it's in Cleveland and I buy it

1052
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:13,070
and don't know how I'm going to get it home.

1053
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:16,323
And don't buy it't know if I's

1054
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:20,410
hot and then see the, you know, covered in rust

1055
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,704
in an engine that knocks.

1056
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,956
Hey, I got it.

1057
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:29,461
It's still, it's sitting in London in a field because it's not worth repairing.

1058
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:35,592
Can you recover any money from it?

1059
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,594
Like sell it for parts or something?

1060
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,806
With that one, I'm going to use

1061
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:45,852
basically all the mechanical parts.

1062
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,647
So like the gas tank with the fuel pump, the.

1063
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,983
Oh, for your RV in case something goes on., I'm going to use all I'

1064
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:55,278
to use as much of that as I can to do my engine

1065
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,531
swap because I'm going to need a radiator.

1066
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,533
I'm going to like a new radiator.

1067
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,201
I'm going to need

1068
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,203
a transmission, and the one in there is the one I want.

1069
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,664
And it's rebuilt.

1070
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,624
That's like the nicest thing in it.

1071
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,709
It's it rebuilt.

1072
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,212
Yeah, it's got like 3,500 miles on a rebuilt.

1073
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,673
Oh, whoa.

1074
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,924
Yeah.

1075
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,718
And I'm going to grab the gas tank and I might use the rear axle

1076
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:21,179
because it has disc brakes in the rear.

1077
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:25,475
Are you going to be keeping any parts on hand in your RV when you're travelinging?

1078
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:30,564
Like any common things that might go out, like a hoses, belt, something like that, that's easy to stow.

1079
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,650
One of the reasons why I

1080
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:38,238
am moving to a newer engine is and it's a very popular engine

1081
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:44,202
is that I can go to any, any parts place and get get parts for it.

1082
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,622
Oh, that's another thing to

1083
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:51,960
think of. is how old the vehicle is will you be able to find parts on your route?

1084
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,421
That's too bra.

1085
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,672
And that, and that engine

1086
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,425
is like the most popular

1087
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:04,431
engine for hot rotting and vehicles, truck engines.

1088
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:07,142
It's just a very, very popular family.

1089
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,144
So

1090
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,646
every, every like

1091
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,482
parts store has the stuff I would need.

1092
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,694
If not, then they can order it for like the next day.

1093
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,946
Right.

1094
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,782
Also, if you need to use tools, that's another good thing.

1095
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,743
If you're RV, you can pull over there.

1096
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,536
If you don't have like all your tools and you need

1097
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:30,040
a breaker bar to get, you know, a nut

1098
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:33,710
off something, ha, you can do that.

1099
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,962
All right.Reilly, they won'tan them to you.

1100
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,923
Yeah, yeah.

1101
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,174
Okay.

1102
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:39,841
So back to

1103
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,469
back to living our lives around our mental health.

1104
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,471
Aside.

1105
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:48,183
I'm trying to hold it back.

1106
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,936
Aide

1107
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,812
from

1108
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:56,399
RVing.

1109
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,902
What, if any, other changes are you making

1110
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,947
to better live with your mental health?

1111
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,450
Well, I mean, just to move into a part-time job.

1112
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:09,287
Well, I mean, two huge things. nomadically, lifestyle

1113
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:12,082
and an RV and then, you know, job change.

1114
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,042
Those are big things

1115
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:16,920
Yeah, those are the two major things that I did,

1116
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:24,135
you know, giving up on the career, realizing that, you know, what

1117
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:28,473
I don't, you kind of redefine success.

1118
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,934
Yes.

1119
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,978
But, You're not getting,

1120
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:38,733
well, well, like most people with me, I don't I don't, I wouldn't say giving up.

1121
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,694
You just realized not.

1122
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,487
Well, you change it.

1123
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:43,238
You change your definition.

1124
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,406
So like

1125
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,449
most people will think, you know, making, getting

1126
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:51,955
into their dream job and being successful and like financial success.

1127
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,374
Right.

1128
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,418
Climbing,imbing the ladder, so to speak.

1129
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,420
That's where I wanted to go.

1130
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:03,008
That's just not meant for everybody, but we're all told that from the beginning

1131
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,343
Yep.

1132
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,638
But, you know, some of us realize that's

1133
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,932
it's just not the thing.

1134
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,934
It's not it.

1135
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,269
No, capitalism can fuck itself.

1136
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,856
I...

1137
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,524
What?

1138
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:20,191
Eat the rich.

1139
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,192
Eat the rich.

1140
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,694
Feed the rich to the hungry.

1141
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,696
Fuck you.

1142
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:25,572
Feed the rich to the hungry and the poor.

1143
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,158
No, I'm not promoting cannibalism.

1144
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,160
A little bit.

1145
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,870
No, no, I'm really not.

1146
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,415
God, if

1147
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:40,462
I got into politics right now, we would, this episode would be so long.

1148
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,672
That's what he said.

1149
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:46,426
How else can you change your life for your mental health?

1150
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:52,015
I mean, I mean, change the place you live.

1151
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,017
I

1152
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,437
I don't know.

1153
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:01,024
I think one thing I would that would

1154
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,818
help because it's going to be different for everybody.

1155
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:08,114
But like picture yourself

1156
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:12,994
in five years if money wasn't wasn't the issue.

1157
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:15,330
There was no issue without what would you be doing?

1158
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:18,958
Or in five years.

1159
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:22,170
What would you be doing if you weren't worried about making money,

1160
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:28,468
weren't worried about climbing the ladder, weren't worried about buying a big house.

1161
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,932
And, you know, if you're like us,

1162
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:38,186
pursue that, set that as your goal.

1163
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,190
If you're like us, meaning mental health?

1164
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:46,694
Meaning that we just don't fit into the cutter.

1165
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,947
The mold that.

1166
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,907
Yeah.

1167
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,826
My pictures of the van build and

1168
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,703
then pictures of the RV build.

1169
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:57,664
Talk about that.

1170
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:58,581
You have two vehicles, actually.

1171
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,458
So what is your plan for that?

1172
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:04,671
The van is going to be more

1173
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:07,882
of a exploration vehicle.

1174
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,843
It's smaller.

1175
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:10,510
It can fit on trails, better.

1176
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,637
Oh, like the away shuttle from the Enterprise.

1177
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,973
Yeah. park and then go sightsee.

1178
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:19,477
But it's not going to go out on every trip with the RV.

1179
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:22,188
It's just going to be like the weekender kind of thing.

1180
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:25,775
And then we also have disced making

1181
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:29,154
a guest room when we're on the road.

1182
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,156
Right.

1183
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,992
I was just going to say, if someone wanted to come join you, yeah, go run by my house.

1184
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,244
My brother's there.

1185
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,287
Here's the keys.

1186
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,289
And then they get in the vehicle and they drive to you.

1187
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,291
Yeah.

1188
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,709
How cool is that?

1189
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:46,588
And then they can just drive back, park it, and, hey, we just visited Brandon.

1190
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,548
Oh, where'd you go?

1191
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,675
Washington State.

1192
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:53,761
That's where they're based right now.

1193
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,763
Why?

1194
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:57,432
Middle of the desert, you know, stuff like that.

1195
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,560
Oh, I mean if it's too hot, I probably won't visit.

1196
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,645
It gets cold at night from what I gather.

1197
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,647
Then I guess I'll be visiting you at night.

1198
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,401
This body doesn't do heat very well.

1199
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,403
Doesn't like it.

1200
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,738
Oh, I don't.

1201
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:15,200
But I also hate winters, so my water is so gross.

1202
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,953
Water?

1203
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:19,871
Yeah, it's so gross.

1204
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,456
It's like.

1205
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:25,210
And I'm not even talking about tap water, like city water.

1206
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:28,963
I'm not even talking about that peatry dish of piss.

1207
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:31,341
I'm talking about just water in general

1208
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,928
is gross and boring.

1209
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,180
I mean, I know we need it.

1210
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,556
Our bodies were like 5,000% water.

1211
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,475
I get it.

1212
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:41,184
That one's for you, Sarah.

1213
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,518
I get it.

1214
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:43,519
I get it.

1215
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:44,062
We're a lot of water, but

1216
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,940
can it have a flavor?

1217
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,942
Like I mean, you can flavor.

1218
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:52,403
Could it not come naturally that way?

1219
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:55,949
Like I think even if it had a flavor,

1220
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,202
we wouldn't be able to taste it.

1221
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,955
Why?

1222
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:02,956
Well, I don't have it.

1223
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:03,831
We're 75% water.

1224
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,833
We drink it all the time.

1225
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,671
I guess. that's fair.

1226
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,550
Well, when I'm in the cave sometimes, I like

1227
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:17,971
to I like to drink some of some of the mineral water that flows to it.

00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,473
I've licked the walls before in a cave.

1229
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:23,685
I've licked the rock wall before just to see what it tasted like,

1230
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,437
you know, and that's how pandemics start, right?

1231
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:30,900
That's how someone randomly get some virus or bacteria that they didn't even know existed

1232
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,195
because they wanted to lick a fucking wall in a cave.

1233
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,447
Was you all alone?

1234
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:37,824
Yeah, it was me.

1235
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,242
It was me.

1236
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:39,909
I went to carter caves and I licked it.
