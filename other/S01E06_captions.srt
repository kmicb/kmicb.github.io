1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,211
Hey, humans, thanks for joining my podcast.

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:09,050
This podcast is a place to share unedited lived experiences regarding mental health.

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,178
We'll touch on how it shows up in our lives and provide

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,474
some tips that have worked for me and others on how to manage it.

5
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,898
There will be strong language and definitely the

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,943
potential for disturbing and or triggering content.

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:30,280
Please be aware of this and mindful of

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,449
others who may be in earshot.

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,036
Most importantly, and as horribly fucking

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,206
cliche as this sounds, you really do not have to go through this alone.

11
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,961
And hopefully you'll see this and feel this more and more as you listen.

12
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:48,923
And hey, if this podcast isn't for you, that's fine.

13
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,176
There are lots of them out there.

14
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,471
Find one that speaks to you and helps you.

15
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,432

00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,460

38
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,638
There is no video for this episode because

39
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:05,977
technology and I can't, yes, me, figure out why.

40
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,689
So, you don't get to see my beautiful face.

41
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,193
Hey, everyone, thank you for joining episode six.

42
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,488
Involuntary harmonies, Trauma, the media,

43
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,199
and the soundtrack of familiar Chaos.

44
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,452
Ref trigger warning.

45
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,956
We will be touching a little on childhood trauma, but not anything specific.

46
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,958
Um Okay, so let's begin.

47
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,919
Reality TV

48
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,881
Most of us have seen some in one form or another.

49
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,801
Some of my favorites from not too long ago.

50
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,305
Jerry Springer, Sally, Jesse Raphael,

51
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:47,185
Phil Donahue, Ricky Lake, Montel Williams, Maury Povich, you are not the father

52
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,772
the many flavors of Housewives, Mary

53
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:55,360
to Medicine, The Bachelor, Bachelorette, the

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,446
last few are not ones that I've watched.

55
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,532
Or actually, I have married to Medicine

56
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:05,578
and some of the housewives I have seen, but not like

57
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,498
no, that's not true.

58
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,457
I have seen.

59
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,459
So I've seen some of the housewives that

60
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,713
I've seen married to medicine, but I have not seen Bachelore Bachelorette.

61
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,800
So some people

62
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,678
love reality TV.

63
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,972
Some people hate it, and some people are in the middle.

64
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,683
Why?

65
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,979
Well, at least two of the aspects we're going to discuss today.

66
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,940
And we're going to dive into why

67
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,192
some people simply cannot live without them

68
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,153
and enjoy them so much.

69
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,698
Or is it that they think they do?

70
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,035
So I liked

71
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,372
what I was watching because entertainment.

72
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,542
You know, you just, you find it entertaining.

73
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,963
And some of these shows, if

74
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:02,885
not all, can construct dramatic relationship narratives.

75
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,887
Why?

76
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,723
To pull you in and get you hooked on the drama.

77
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,934
Because let's face it, watching someone else's drama unfold

78
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,730
kind of takes your mind off of your own,

79
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,190
even if only for 30 minutes or an hour.

80
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:22,447
These dramatic narratives are intentionally amplified, you know, to get us to get viewers.

81
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,699
A majority of

82
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,869
conflicts in these shows are scripted.

83
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:32,707
Not all, but, you know, some are to get, you know, ratings to stay on the air.

84
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,668
Kind of, okay, so think of it like,

85
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,796
now, hear me out.

86
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:42,717
Don't get pissed off for all of those who like this.

87
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,053
But think of it kind of like professional wrestling.

88
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,097
It's more like a soap

89
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:52,018
opera than actual physical violence, even though they do

90
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:57,607
unintentionally, some of them get very, very, very much hurts.

91
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:01,027
So it's more like a soap opera than actual,

92
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:06,574
you know, wrestling, and all of the actors are, you know, men in tights.

93
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,534
Tght tights.

94
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,827
So the people who watch

95
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,121
for wrestling, they know this.

96
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:15,124
They know it's not real, yet they're still drawn

97
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,461
to it as if it was, or as if it were.

98
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,547
So, and we can discuss way later, why there are

99
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,218
some humans who love to watch other humans get beat the fuck up.

100
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,428
Another topic.

101
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,099
So these shows have these

102
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,435
psychological mechanisms

103
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,316
that are purposefully put in them to

104
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:45,571
influence us, kind of like subliminal messaging, but not subliminal messaging.

105
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,532
So what's this mean?

106
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,535
So we are unconsciously taking in specific dramatic

107
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:54,205
instances that we're watching on TV or a

108
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,749
streaming service or movies wherever you are.

109
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,751
And then we

110
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,254
take that and just broadly apply

111
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,257
that to other entire groups of humans.

112
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,259
Example.

113
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,469
People that watch multiple reality shows,

114
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:14,600
you know, that proudly showcase unfaithful male partners

115
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,479
can lead someone to uncciously believe

116
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:24,193
that most, if not all men, are prone to, you know, being unfaithful.

117
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,864
This constant exposure to cheating,

118
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:32,118
lying, betrayal, toxic male, bullshit, can,

119
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:36,539
you know, foster heightened anxiety, you know, in relationships,

120
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,459
preemptive defense mechanisms for something

121
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:44,213
that hasn't even happened, and unrealistic

122
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:48,009
expectations about, you know, partner behavior and

123
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,305
even potential trust issues before a relationship has even begun.

124
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,225
So this cognitive

125
00:07:56,267 --> 00:08:01,230
distortion, love these words, allows us,

126
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,276
our brain, to quickly categorize the information, but

127
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,113
usually dangerously inaccurate

128
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:13,034
when simply based on, you know, sensationalized

129
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:18,164
representations, which is an intentional tactic to

130
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,542
distort and exaggerate the facts to cause a

131
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,879
strong emotional reaction in us and grab our

132
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,758
attention, which it does, but The massive problem with this,

133
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:34,305
though, is it creates distorted portrayals that make it very difficult

134
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,892
for some to figure out what is fact and

135
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,144
what is our overdramatized bullshit.

136
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,940
There's this thing called social learning theory,

137
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,652
which simply suggests that humans learn behaviors

138
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,863
by watching and mimicking, you know, what we see

139
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,077
in our personal little bubble, which literally what children do growing up.

140
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,247
In the context of media, though, and what we're talking about,

141
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,708
this means humans can often internalize those

142
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,212
relationship dnamics, the communication styles, and

143
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,590
the conflict resolution methods that you see in these shows, which

144
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,842
usually are not fantastic

145
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,888
When this, you know, is consistently portrayed

146
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:21,143
dramatically, confrontational interactions as normal,

147
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:25,273
you, especially, though some people can, even

148
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:29,235
people who have no relationship experience, some relationship,

149
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,655
or decades of it, can unconsciously accept

150
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,200
that these behaviors are acceptable and even expecteded

151
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,619
in these relationships.

152
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,581
So those who grew up

153
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:46,210
with constant conflict in traumatic environments creates

154
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,213
kind of an emotional baseline.

155
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,968
Have you ever heard of familial dysfunction?

156
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:59,932
What about familiar dysfunction, which is in the title of the this episode?

157
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,477
So in this context, they are very much

158
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,815
closely related siblings, if you will.

159
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,942
Familial dysfunction relates to your family

160
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,696
Familiar dysfunction is something that

161
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,949
feels known, comfortable, hence familiar.

162
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,161
In these situations, you can sometimes

163
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:24,248
seek out these shows or

164
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,336
movies in the media that damn near mirrors

165
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:31,172
your early emotional experiences

166
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:35,468
because what you saw growing up became

167
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,639
your emotional normalcy a swine.

168
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,975
For those trauma survivors, consuming these

169
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,645
distortions can actually be a form of of emotional regulation.

170
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:48,606
The

171
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,858
psychological mechanism is rooted in the concept

172
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:54,028
of mere exposure effect, which means being exposed

173
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,365
to something repeatedly, especially at an early age when

174
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,743
your brain is still developing and trying to make heads or tails of all this fucked

175
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,663
up world creates a sense of safety and predict

176
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,166
Damn it.

177
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:07,917
Creates a sense of safety.

178
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,294
I'm going to edit that out, and predictability.

179
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,464
So you find comfort in

180
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:17,927
the familiar, even though it was full of horrible, harmful dynamics.

181
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,389
Remember, all of this reality

182
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:26,060
consumption, can be a form of emotional regulation for us.

183
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,270
So, we need to break this cycle, right?

184
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,272
So how do we do this?

185
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,691
Well, through awareness.

186
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:36,028
Another word for awareness, mindfulness.

187
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,115
Being mindful will help you to recognize

188
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,618
the differences between, you know, what is true entertainment

189
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:46,539
and what healthy relationships look like.

190
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,208
Both can be true at the same time, yes.

191
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,210
It's also important to

192
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,379
look for patterns.

193
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,214
Why do you watch these these shows?

194
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,509
And is it only when you're sad or depressed?

195
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,429
Is it only when you're in a mood that you watch it?

196
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:06,559
Or do you just, you know, watch it in general just because, you know, fun, entertaininging?

197
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,936
Or because it's comfortable or familiar?

198
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,188
Think about it.

199
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:11,856
The next time you want to watch one.

200
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,108
Think about why you want to watch it.

201
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,986
If there is a why, other than it's entertaining.

202
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,240
Try to see if there's a reason more

203
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:26,245
so than just the entertainment of why you're drawn to want to see it.

204
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,205
So we have to break

205
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,084
the generational patterns that, you know, you grew

206
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,336
up with and how, how.

207
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:38,299
Okay, create healthy boundaries, something that I

208
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,178
was not good at. in the beginning,

209
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,472
but it becomes easier the more you set

210
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,225
Learn new strategies and,

211
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:52,772
you know, therapy, you know, professional, professional humans that can help us.

212
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,732
I've seen many.

213
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,691
They are fantastic.

214
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,942
I can vouch for it.

215
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,361
So, as we close,

216
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,865
my very much melodramatic, overproduced episode, let's

217
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,076
reflect on some of this shit.

218
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:10,706
Reity TV may just be the junk food of our emotional diet

219
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,460
Very tasty, very addictive, like that white cheddar popcorn.

220
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,462
Oh, my God.

221
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,424
But it's best enjoyed in moderation, unlike that white cheddar popcorn.

222
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,635
I eat the family size bag as a snack.

223
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,637
It's so fucking good.

224
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,097
Anyway, so if you find yourself George drawn to these

225
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,350
shows, like a moth to a dumpster fire

226
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,769
that's okay.

227
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,438
Sometimes watching Karen flip a table or

228
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,067
Morey dramatically reveal that he's not the father, well, no,

229
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,611
not Maury himself, but that'd be a funny episode.

230
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,614
It's just the catharsis that you need, right?

231
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,616
So life's already full of

232
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,536
horrible, unscripted bullshit.

233
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,747
So, you know, might as well watch someone else's for a change.

234
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,707
All right, thanks for joining me, everyone.

235
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,627
And here's to finding the balance between entertainment

236
00:13:56,627 --> 00:14:00,881
and emotional chaos, breaking generational cycles

237
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,719
and most importantly, knowing when to change the channel.

238
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,890
While reality TV may keep us hooked, healing

239
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,435
is the ultimate season finale worth binging.

240
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,522
Okay, that's all the time we have today.

241
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,191
Thank you, everyone who joined and listened.

242
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,570
I truly hope you were able to take something from

243
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,531
this that will help you better manage your mental health.

244
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:30,661
Please also keep in your mind that this takes work and time.

245
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,663
There is no quick fix.

246
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,833
So please allow yourself some grace and compassion.

247
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,628
I hope you join again next time as we continue dismantling

248
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,590
the ridiculous stigma that surrounds mental health

249
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:47,052
And until next time, don't throat punch anyone.

250
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,762
Bye-bye
