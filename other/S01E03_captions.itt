      <p begin="00:02:57:07" end="00:02:59:06" region="bottom">Hello, everybody.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:59:06" end="00:03:02:23" region="bottom">We are talking about building your life</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03:14" end="00:03:05:13" region="bottom">around your mental health.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05:13" end="00:03:08:18" region="bottom">We touched briefly on it last week with Brandon here,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:08:19" end="00:03:11:23" region="bottom">my guest, and I decided that</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11:23" end="00:03:14:20" region="bottom">would be a great next episode.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:14:20" end="00:03:19:22" region="bottom">I was thinking maybe doing a bonus or like a behind the scenes thing, but this is</p>
      <p begin="00:03:20:07" end="00:03:23:06" region="bottom">neither because it</p>
      <p begin="00:03:23:07" end="00:03:26:09" region="bottom">just ties into the topic mental health and</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26:10" end="00:03:29:14" region="bottom">you know, how do we deal with it?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:29:14" end="00:03:31:13" region="bottom">How do we live with it?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:31:13" end="00:03:33:03" region="bottom">Most people fight it.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:33:03" end="00:03:34:09" region="bottom">I've been fighting it decades</p>
      <p begin="00:03:35:01" end="00:03:37:17" region="bottom">And I'm I don't want to anymore.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:37:18" end="00:03:39:17" region="bottom">I don't don't want to fight it.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39:17" end="00:03:41:12" region="bottom">I want to work with it.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:41:12" end="00:03:42:11" region="bottom">It's clearly here to stay.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:42:11" end="00:03:45:00" region="bottom">It has good days and bad days, but.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:47:14" end="00:03:49:13" region="bottom">I need to stop fighting it.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:49:13" end="00:03:52:05" region="bottom">So, Brandon, welcome again.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:52:06" end="00:03:54:05" region="bottom">Tell us.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56:22" end="00:04:02:18" region="bottom">how you got the idea of building your life around mental health.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:02:19" end="00:04:04:18" region="bottom">Yeah, we'll just start there.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04:18" end="00:04:06:13" region="bottom">How'd you get that idea?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06:13" end="00:04:09:13" region="bottom">Like, what clicked or what made you think, oh, this isn't working anymore.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09:14" end="00:04:11:13" region="bottom">Let's try this.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:11:13" end="00:04:14:11" region="bottom">Well, I wanted to live nomatically</p>
      <p begin="00:04:14:12" end="00:04:16:23" region="bottom">for basically my entire adult life.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:17:17" end="00:04:19:16" region="bottom">But when</p>
      <p begin="00:04:21:00" end="00:04:24:01" region="bottom">when I had the second surgery, the second heart surgery</p>
      <p begin="00:04:24:02" end="00:04:28:23" region="bottom">and all of that went down, I just, I couldn't ignore that impulse anymore.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:30:10" end="00:04:33:18" region="bottom">It just, you know, it's time to be happier.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:33:19" end="00:04:37:03" region="bottom">And then also the infection was super dangerous.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:37:03" end="00:04:39:21" region="bottom">The whole reason I had the second surgery was that infection.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:39:22" end="00:04:42:23" region="bottom">You brushed with death twice, survived.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:43:23" end="00:04:46:23" region="bottom">And that's when you decided, I need to make some</p>
      <p begin="00:04:46:23" end="00:04:51:03" region="bottom">changes because you're not happy and you need to live your life the way you want to.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:51:04" end="00:04:53:03" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:53:03" end="00:04:56:00" region="bottom">So explain how you were living your life and then</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56:22" end="00:05:00:12" region="bottom">we know what was the c was for the change.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:00:12" end="00:05:03:21" region="bottom">So explain how or how you were living and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:03:22" end="00:05:06:15" region="bottom">now how you are transitioning to where you want to be.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:07:04" end="00:05:11:23" region="bottom">So before I've always had engineer type positions</p>
      <p begin="00:05:12:19" end="00:05:14:18" region="bottom">NIT.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:14:18" end="00:05:16:01" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16:01" end="00:05:18:08" region="bottom">So I started out as a network engineer and</p>
      <p begin="00:05:18:09" end="00:05:23:05" region="bottom">had a mental health collapse when that was going on.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:23:06" end="00:05:25:05" region="bottom">So I switched to</p>
      <p begin="00:05:25:10" end="00:05:28:15" region="bottom">a job that I thought I would like more in classroom design</p>
      <p begin="00:05:28:15" end="00:05:31:21" region="bottom">and managing contractors and all of that.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:33:04" end="00:05:37:02" region="bottom">But it still was I was just still struggling with it.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:37:02" end="00:05:39:01" region="bottom">I don't really fit into the</p>
      <p begin="00:05:39:01" end="00:05:42:03" region="bottom">the normal societal life where I have</p>
      <p begin="00:05:42:04" end="00:05:45:05" region="bottom">this big long career because I don't know.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:45:06" end="00:05:47:05" region="bottom">My mind's just not wired for that.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48:03" end="00:05:52:04" region="bottom">Tell just briefly what classroom design is so people know.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52:04" end="00:05:56:17" region="bottom">You work for a university, so let them know what classroom design means..</p>
      <p begin="00:05:56:18" end="00:05:58:17" region="bottom">So I would</p>
      <p begin="00:05:58:17" end="00:06:02:22" region="bottom">draw a blueprint or really have kind of blueprints for the room layout.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:02:22" end="00:06:06:20" region="bottom">I would create wiring diagrams and then transpose those</p>
      <p begin="00:06:08:09" end="00:06:11:09" region="bottom">that all that all the</p>
      <p begin="00:06:11:09" end="00:06:14:00" region="bottom">wiring diagrams compassed onto the blueprints.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:14:00" end="00:06:17:01" region="bottom">So the contractors install it.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:17:01" end="00:06:19:00" region="bottom">And then I would</p>
      <p begin="00:06:19:00" end="00:06:23:20" region="bottom">follow the project and make sure the contractors were doing it correctly.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:24:08" end="00:06:26:07" region="bottom">I was also doing the scopes of work.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:27:14" end="00:06:32:22" region="bottom">And this was all for setting up network infrastructure, audio audio video in a classroom?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:32:23" end="00:06:36:07" region="bottom">This was when I was in the classroom technology.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:37:08" end="00:06:39:07" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:39:07" end="00:06:40:20" region="bottom">So was it like a professor would say, hey, this classroom sucks.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:40:21" end="00:06:42:20" region="bottom">I need this in here.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:42:20" end="00:06:43:19" region="bottom">Or upgrgrades.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:43:19" end="00:06:45:20" region="bottom">Usually it would be like the department.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:46:02" end="00:06:48:01" region="bottom">Oh, okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:48:01" end="00:06:48:18" region="bottom">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:48:18" end="00:06:49:23" region="bottom">Or sometimes we were just doing mass upgrades and it was really</p>
      <p begin="00:06:50:18" end="00:06:53:13" region="bottom">my decision and my supervisor's decision.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:54:02" end="00:06:56:01" region="bottom">Okay..</p>
      <p begin="00:06:56:01" end="00:06:57:22" region="bottom">So you were a network engineer and</p>
      <p begin="00:06:57:23" end="00:07:01:13" region="bottom">then did not like switch to classroom design?</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01:22" end="00:07:03:21" region="bottom">Don't really fit that.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:03:21" end="00:07:05:18" region="bottom">Continue.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05:18" end="00:07:07:00" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:07:00" end="00:07:08:00" region="bottom">And I I found every time I got myself into a routine</p>
      <p begin="00:07:08:12" end="00:07:13:01" region="bottom">like just like the normal routine, I would just fall apart.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14:07" end="00:07:19:18" region="bottom">Even if I like like getting up, getting dressed, going to work work, come home, rinse repeat.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:20:01" end="00:07:22:00" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:22:00" end="00:07:24:03" region="bottom">So, I mean, even even though like at</p>
      <p begin="00:07:24:03" end="00:07:27:00" region="bottom">the beginning of these jobs, I was really happy and exciting.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:27:00" end="00:07:28:23" region="bottom">It just wore off.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:28:23" end="00:07:32:09" region="bottom">And then I would lapse again.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:32:10" end="00:07:34:16" region="bottom">I Yeah, I know that feeling.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:34:16" end="00:07:36:15" region="bottom">Kind of like.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:36:15" end="00:07:38:06" region="bottom">Like a honeymoon period.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:38:06" end="00:07:40:04" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:40:04" end="00:07:41:20" region="bottom">What they would say, you know, relationships have that honeymoon phase.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:41:21" end="00:07:43:20" region="bottom">Most every job I've worked</p>
      <p begin="00:07:44:14" end="00:07:48:10" region="bottom">um, well, all, but I. Sorry.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:48:10" end="00:07:52:12" region="bottom">All but one or two jobs were IT.T.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54:18" end="00:07:56:17" region="bottom">And I loved them all in the beginning.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:56:17" end="00:07:58:13" region="bottom">Like it was fantastic.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:58:13" end="00:08:00:17" region="bottom">And I don't know if it was just because, oh, new job, exciting.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:01:06" end="00:08:03:05" region="bottom">Or if it's</p>
      <p begin="00:08:04:06" end="00:08:06:05" region="bottom">new job exciting, great.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06:05" end="00:08:08:15" region="bottom">I love what I do, but then something, either the</p>
      <p begin="00:08:08:16" end="00:08:12:12" region="bottom">people, the environment, or my mental health, it's no longer fun.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:12:12" end="00:08:17:09" region="bottom">And then it becomes very, I get very irritated, very agitated.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:17:10" end="00:08:21:10" region="bottom">You know, people are calling for help and the last thing I want to do is help them</p>
      <p begin="00:08:22:02" end="00:08:25:05" region="bottom">And I don't know if</p>
      <p begin="00:08:26:00" end="00:08:28:22" region="bottom">that's my mental health or</p>
      <p begin="00:08:30:12" end="00:08:33:19" region="bottom">maybe those positions weren't for me, because</p>
      <p begin="00:08:33:19" end="00:08:37:04" region="bottom">in general, I've never really liked to deal with the general public.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:37:05" end="00:08:40:06" region="bottom">But as you, yeah, maybe.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:40:06" end="00:08:43:20" region="bottom">But as you know, most IT people,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:43:21" end="00:08:48:17" region="bottom">we start at the help desk when we get our foot in the door in this world.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:48:17" end="00:08:50:16" region="bottom">And</p>
      <p begin="00:08:50:16" end="00:08:51:05" region="bottom">that was fun.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:51:05" end="00:08:52:18" region="bottom">I loved it because I love helping people.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:55:07" end="00:08:59:23" region="bottom">But it started to get irritating and</p>
      <p begin="00:09:00:00" end="00:09:03:21" region="bottom">resentful that these people don't know how to do what they're calling me</p>
      <p begin="00:09:05:03" end="00:09:07:02" region="bottom">to know how to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:07:02" end="00:09:10:01" region="bottom">And my job is to help them do what they don't know how to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:10:01" end="00:09:13:04" region="bottom">Sometimes you're just like, you know, Google's a thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:13:10" end="00:09:15:09" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:15:09" end="00:09:16:06" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:16:06" end="00:09:17:00" region="bottom">But</p>
      <p begin="00:09:17:00" end="00:09:18:12" region="bottom">right.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:18:12" end="00:09:19:06" region="bottom">But that's what we're there for.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:19:06" end="00:09:21:03" region="bottom">That's what the help desk is for.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:21:03" end="00:09:22:16" region="bottom">You know, you don't, I don't, I don't.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:22:22" end="00:09:26:05" region="bottom">I've had someone call me and ask where a bathroom was in</p>
      <p begin="00:09:26:06" end="00:09:29:05" region="bottom">a building that I used to work at because they didn't know who else to call.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:29:06" end="00:09:31:05" region="bottom">So they called the help desk.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:31:05" end="00:09:33:03" region="bottom">I had some people.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33:03" end="00:09:34:04" region="bottom">I had somebody call and asking where to park</p>
      <p begin="00:09:34:12" end="00:09:36:11" region="bottom">Yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:36:11" end="00:09:38:03" region="bottom">Yeah, the IT help deskk.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:38:10" end="00:09:40:09" region="bottom">One-stop shop.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:40:16" end="00:09:43:13" region="bottom">It's like you're concierge, wherever you are.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:43:13" end="00:09:46:21" region="bottom">Okay, so back where we were.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:48:21" end="00:09:50:20" region="bottom">Engineer?</p>
      <p begin="00:09:50:20" end="00:09:51:22" region="bottom">No.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:51:22" end="00:09:52:14" region="bottom">Classroom tech, no.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:52:15" end="00:09:54:14" region="bottom">Now you are</p>
      <p begin="00:09:56:03" end="00:09:59:10" region="bottom">realizing you don't, it does doesn't fit you.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:59:11" end="00:10:01:10" region="bottom">So continue for me.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:01:10" end="00:10:04:15" region="bottom">So I just, I have all this</p>
      <p begin="00:10:04:16" end="00:10:08:04" region="bottom">weird knowledge about IT and different aspects of</p>
      <p begin="00:10:08:23" end="00:10:13:19" region="bottom">IT, you know, programming, networking, um, design and all that.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:13:20" end="00:10:16:21" region="bottom">So I took all my experience and all</p>
      <p begin="00:10:16:21" end="00:10:20:20" region="bottom">of my, my education and got a help desk job.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:21:03" end="00:10:24:06" region="bottom">But I was able to find a part-time</p>
      <p begin="00:10:24:06" end="00:10:26:16" region="bottom">one and it's a it's a remote position</p>
      <p begin="00:10:27:14" end="00:10:29:13" region="bottom">Right now.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:29:13" end="00:10:30:08" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:30:08" end="00:10:31:22" region="bottom">Which are the two things I wanted more most.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:31:22" end="00:10:35:07" region="bottom">So I, yeah, I was happy to switch.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:35:08" end="00:10:37:07" region="bottom">My doctor was happy.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:37:07" end="00:10:38:09" region="bottom">I switched.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:38:09" end="00:10:40:20" region="bottom">Oh and all, everybody was happier.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:40:21" end="00:10:42:20" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:42:20" end="00:10:45:08" region="bottom">I. When I, when, when COVID</p>
      <p begin="00:10:45:08" end="00:10:50:05" region="bottom">happened and we and most, a lot of people switched to working from home, I was so happy.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:50:06" end="00:10:52:05" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:52:05" end="00:10:54:16" region="bottom">Most IT people, though, you know, we can work from home, depending</p>
      <p begin="00:10:54:17" end="00:10:58:08" region="bottom">on what our job is, because we can just remote in and do what we need to do</p>
      <p begin="00:10:59:00" end="00:11:02:07" region="bottom">I noticed</p>
      <p begin="00:11:02:08" end="00:11:05:20" region="bottom">my mental health improved when I had to stop going</p>
      <p begin="00:11:05:20" end="00:11:09:17" region="bottom">in and I could be in my own comfortable, safe environment</p>
      <p begin="00:11:09:18" end="00:11:14:04" region="bottom">at home, wearing pretty much whatever I want from the waist down</p>
      <p begin="00:11:14:20" end="00:11:17:11" region="bottom">just be careful when you stand up.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:17:12" end="00:11:19:21" region="bottom">If you're on a virtual call, call people.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:19:21" end="00:11:21:20" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:22:07" end="00:11:27:06" region="bottom">So my mental health, it improved because I'm someone I don't</p>
      <p begin="00:11:28:04" end="00:11:30:03" region="bottom">uh, it's not a need.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:30:03" end="00:11:34:00" region="bottom">I just don't, have, um, the ability</p>
      <p begin="00:11:34:01" end="00:11:38:21" region="bottom">to be in someone's presence physically doesn't really exist with me.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:38:21" end="00:11:42:22" region="bottom">Like, if I never saw another human in person</p>
      <p begin="00:11:44:07" end="00:11:46:15" region="bottom">I, it wouldn't phase me.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:46:15" end="00:11:49:16" region="bottom">Virtual is plenty for me.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:49:16" end="00:11:54:03" region="bottom">If I can see you and we can chat and it's real time, that's enough. for me.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:54:04" end="00:11:57:05" region="bottom">I don't I don't have to be in your presence to feel something.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:57:20" end="00:12:01:10" region="bottom">But on the flip side, I have noticed when</p>
      <p begin="00:12:01:10" end="00:12:04:14" region="bottom">I am physically around people, I do get a</p>
      <p begin="00:12:04:14" end="00:12:06:23" region="bottom">little more of a boost in my mental health.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:07:06" end="00:12:09:05" region="bottom">So it's a double edged short.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:09:05" end="00:12:11:03" region="bottom">It's like, I don't want to be around you people, but</p>
      <p begin="00:12:11:19" end="00:12:15:09" region="bottom">because you annoy me and my mental health suffers.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:15:09" end="00:12:19:22" region="bottom">But being around you helps my mental health a little bit.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:19:23" end="00:12:23:04" region="bottom">So what the hell are you supposed to do when you don't want to be around</p>
      <p begin="00:12:23:04" end="00:12:25:16" region="bottom">people, but you have to be around people?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:26:12" end="00:12:28:11" region="bottom">It's.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:28:11" end="00:12:29:17" region="bottom">Do what?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:29:17" end="00:12:30:17" region="bottom">Answer phones.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:30:17" end="00:12:32:09" region="bottom">Answer phones.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:32:09" end="00:12:33:21" region="bottom">Yeah, yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:33:21" end="00:12:36:07" region="bottom">Okay, so you took all your skills, got this current job</p>
      <p begin="00:12:36:07" end="00:12:39:06" region="bottom">working from home, and you like this better.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:39:07" end="00:12:41:06" region="bottom">I I'm sure.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:41:06" end="00:12:42:02" region="bottom">Oh, yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:42:02" end="00:12:42:18" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:42:18" end="00:12:44:07" region="bottom">I make a lot less money, but I'm also.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:44:08" end="00:12:46:07" region="bottom">But you're happier.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:46:07" end="00:12:47:03" region="bottom">I'm so much happier.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:47:03" end="00:12:49:07" region="bottom">And I don't deal with the same levels of stress</p>
      <p begin="00:12:49:19" end="00:12:53:19" region="bottom">Like my job is almost no stress.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:53:19" end="00:12:57:00" region="bottom">I when I hang up the phone on somebody, it's over.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:57:01" end="00:12:59:00" region="bottom">My part's done.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:59:00" end="00:12:59:17" region="bottom">It goes on to next person.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:00:17" end="00:13:02:16" region="bottom">Well, the problem's not sol.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:02:16" end="00:13:04:04" region="bottom">I can do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:04:04" end="00:13:07:00" region="bottom">I always had this horrible, horrible,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:07:00" end="00:13:11:13" region="bottom">actually, it's not a horrible thing to have, but follow through, like, what they call follow through.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:11:13" end="00:13:13:22" region="bottom">Even though I'm done, where where we?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:14:04" end="00:13:16:03" region="bottom">See, that's what happens when I go off</p>
      <p begin="00:13:16:13" end="00:13:18:12" region="bottom">on a tangent.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:18:12" end="00:13:20:03" region="bottom">I work help us now.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:20:03" end="00:13:22:19" region="bottom">You work I work help desk now, yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:22:20" end="00:13:25:15" region="bottom">And from home and you noticed it is better for your mental health.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:25:15" end="00:13:27:21" region="bottom">Why, though?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:27:22" end="00:13:31:04" region="bottom">Like, what, what aspect is better for your mental health?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:32:04" end="00:13:36:08" region="bottom">Well, I don't have the stress or the pressure.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:36:09" end="00:13:40:22" region="bottom">I I don't have to come in and do the same thing nearly every day.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:42:06" end="00:13:44:05" region="bottom">I just kind of.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:44:05" end="00:13:45:05" region="bottom">So it's not monotonous?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:45:05" end="00:13:46:17" region="bottom">Your calls are different every time?</p>
      <p begin="00:13:46:22" end="00:13:50:09" region="bottom">No, not really, but I only have to do it 20 hours a week.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:50:16" end="00:13:52:15" region="bottom">Oh.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:53:04" end="00:13:56:09" region="bottom">Yeah, it's just just not as main.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:56:09" end="00:13:58:18" region="bottom">It's not the main focus of my life anymore.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:58:19" end="00:14:01:09" region="bottom">I don't have to work a third of my days.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:02:03" end="00:14:04:02" region="bottom">Yeah, working to live</p>
      <p begin="00:14:04:10" end="00:14:06:09" region="bottom">or living to work.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:06:09" end="00:14:07:15" region="bottom">I never get those right.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:07:15" end="00:14:11:08" region="bottom">So yeah, I might make dozens of dollars, but I'm happier.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:11:09" end="00:14:13:19" region="bottom">And that's the thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:13:20" end="00:14:16:18" region="bottom">My, you know, I've had a job where I had</p>
      <p begin="00:14:17:15" end="00:14:20:20" region="bottom">a very good salary, but I wasn't happy.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:21:21" end="00:14:25:06" region="bottom">And then Lou said job, and</p>
      <p begin="00:14:25:07" end="00:14:28:09" region="bottom">then some other things happen, and you go on this spiral.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:28:09" end="00:14:30:14" region="bottom">But overall,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:31:09" end="00:14:33:08" region="bottom">I'm happy.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:33:09" end="00:14:36:17" region="bottom">Like, I don't.. not having the stress,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:36:17" end="00:14:40:10" region="bottom">like, of something like that, the anxiety,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:40:11" end="00:14:43:16" region="bottom">the horribleness that it does to</p>
      <p begin="00:14:43:16" end="00:14:46:20" region="bottom">your body, the adrenaline dumps, the panic its attacks,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:46:20" end="00:14:50:03" region="bottom">the tension, the sucking your tongue and holding</p>
      <p begin="00:14:50:04" end="00:14:54:05" region="bottom">it to the roof of your mouth because you're so stressed out, grinding your teeth</p>
      <p begin="00:14:54:17" end="00:14:58:02" region="bottom">gzing your hands, keeping your neck tense in your shoulders,</p>
      <p begin="00:14:58:14" end="00:15:02:19" region="bottom">all of that is mental health manifested physically, all of it.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:02:19" end="00:15:05:13" region="bottom">And some most people don't even realize they're doing it.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:05:20" end="00:15:07:19" region="bottom">And staying tense like this</p>
      <p begin="00:15:08:08" end="00:15:12:13" region="bottom">eight hours a day while you're working, not so good for the body.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:13:08" end="00:15:15:07" region="bottom">Not so good at all.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:15:07" end="00:15:16:17" region="bottom">Okay, so what are you doing then?</p>
      <p begin="00:15:18:01" end="00:15:20:17" region="bottom">So, yeah, now I have a remote job. oil.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:20:17" end="00:15:22:16" region="bottom">I only work part-time.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:22:16" end="00:15:26:06" region="bottom">And now my partner and I are we're renovating</p>
      <p begin="00:15:26:07" end="00:15:29:13" region="bottom">in our B, and we we're just going to live in it and travel.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:30:01" end="00:15:32:00" region="bottom">Talk about that.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:32:01" end="00:15:35:09" region="bottom">So yeah, that's actually one of the main reasons why I wanted a part-time</p>
      <p begin="00:15:35:10" end="00:15:40:19" region="bottom">remote positions, because I don't know, I've always been drawn to a nomadic lifestyle.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:41:13" end="00:15:46:20" region="bottom">Really, I think it has hard to do with like my trauma and then part to do with</p>
      <p begin="00:15:47:08" end="00:15:49:07" region="bottom">being bipolar.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:49:07" end="00:15:52:01" region="bottom">I just don't quite</p>
      <p begin="00:15:52:02" end="00:15:56:00" region="bottom">survive well into regular societal life.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:57:13" end="00:16:00:02" region="bottom">So yeah, now we're working on the RV.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:00:02" end="00:16:04:18" region="bottom">I'm way more excited for the future.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:04:19" end="00:16:08:04" region="bottom">I don't picture myself in five</p>
      <p begin="00:16:08:05" end="00:16:11:22" region="bottom">years doing the same thing and being stressed out.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:11:22" end="00:16:13:21" region="bottom">So that's been great.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:14:18" end="00:16:17:21" region="bottom">So you actually have a vision of the future that's no</p>
      <p begin="00:16:17:22" end="00:16:20:06" region="bottom">longer stressful or anxious.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:20:18" end="00:16:22:17" region="bottom">Exactly.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:22:17" end="00:16:24:17" region="bottom">It's just, yeah, it's just exciting.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:24:18" end="00:16:27:19" region="bottom">So when you say a nomadic lifestyle,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:27:19" end="00:16:30:07" region="bottom">you talk more about that.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:30:07" end="00:16:33:12" region="bottom">Like, you're not just going to up and move into an RV and</p>
      <p begin="00:16:33:13" end="00:16:36:18" region="bottom">then just travel the country and never, I guess,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:36:19" end="00:16:39:04" region="bottom">have like a quote unquote home base or something.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:39:04" end="00:16:42:15" region="bottom">You still plan to have like, you know, home base.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:42:16" end="00:16:47:02" region="bottom">If we're going to have a home base, I don't know how often we'll be here.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:47:17" end="00:16:51:05" region="bottom">But in America, being</p>
      <p begin="00:16:51:05" end="00:16:53:22" region="bottom">homeless is apparently a bad option.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:54:05" end="00:16:56:04" region="bottom">Being un housed, yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:58:11" end="00:17:00:10" region="bottom">They get mad.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:00:10" end="00:17:04:04" region="bottom">It's best to have a physical address somewhere.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:04:13" end="00:17:06:12" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:06:12" end="00:17:08:16" region="bottom">Because society doesn't like nomads.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:08:16" end="00:17:10:15" region="bottom">You know, we're</p>
      <p begin="00:17:11:11" end="00:17:14:11" region="bottom">So you have an RV that</p>
      <p begin="00:17:14:12" end="00:17:18:22" region="bottom">you purchased a used one, and you gutted it, right?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:18:22" end="00:17:20:21" region="bottom">Inside.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:20:21" end="00:17:23:08" region="bottom">And I know you just told me you did,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:23:09" end="00:17:26:13" region="bottom">you had to rewire the wiring harness for the engine because you</p>
      <p begin="00:17:26:13" end="00:17:28:21" region="bottom">put, well, you tell, you talk about it.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:28:21" end="00:17:32:10" region="bottom">Walk us through what you did from buying me in until right now.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:33:04" end="00:17:35:03" region="bottom">So we bought it.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:35:03" end="00:17:37:17" region="bottom">We wanted a something not normal, something cool.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:37:18" end="00:17:41:04" region="bottom">So we bought a a 1972 RV.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:41:12" end="00:17:43:11" region="bottom">So it's got, it's really cute.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:43:11" end="00:17:48:09" region="bottom">It's got all kinds of character, but it also gets like four miles to now.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:48:22" end="00:17:51:18" region="bottom">The thing that thing is never met a gas station.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:51:18" end="00:17:53:17" region="bottom">It doesn't like.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:53:17" end="00:17:54:14" region="bottom">Is it gas or diesel?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:54:14" end="00:17:56:03" region="bottom">Yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:56:03" end="00:17:56:23" region="bottom">G. It's a big block.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:57:00" end="00:17:59:10" region="bottom">Have you thought about converting it?</p>
      <p begin="00:17:59:22" end="00:18:01:21" region="bottom">To diesel?</p>
      <p begin="00:18:01:21" end="00:18:03:11" region="bottom">Well, not straight diesel.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:03:12" end="00:18:07:15" region="bottom">Like the hybrid one where you can just go get like</p>
      <p begin="00:18:07:23" end="00:18:11:14" region="bottom">french fry oil and, you know, obviously strain and filter.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:11:15" end="00:18:13:14" region="bottom">Yeah, you can clean, but I met something like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:13:14" end="00:18:15:04" region="bottom">You have to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:15:04" end="00:18:16:01" region="bottom">You have to have a diesel to do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:16:01" end="00:18:17:11" region="bottom">Oh, you have.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:17:11" end="00:18:21:04" region="bottom">But what I am doing, I took a, I got an engine out of a</p>
      <p begin="00:18:22:01" end="00:18:25:09" region="bottom">just a Chevy, 2500, and I'm really builtbuilding it.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:26:09" end="00:18:29:12" region="bottom">And I'm just going to do an engine swap with</p>
      <p begin="00:18:29:13" end="00:18:32:09" region="bottom">a modern engine and get g injection and cruise control.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:33:17" end="00:18:36:02" region="bottom">All of the nice things, a check engine light.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:36:15" end="00:18:40:14" region="bottom">That light that's always on no matter how new your car is.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:40:21" end="00:18:43:16" region="bottom">And then maybe get nine to 11 miles down.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:43:16" end="00:18:45:15" region="bottom">Maybe.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:45:15" end="00:18:47:09" region="bottom">What?</p>
      <p begin="00:18:48:14" end="00:18:50:19" region="bottom">I can't even scroll back in the captions.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:51:20" end="00:18:54:03" region="bottom">I really don't like these captions.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:54:04" end="00:18:56:19" region="bottom">But I that's how I...</p>
      <p begin="00:18:56:19" end="00:19:00:00" region="bottom">Oh, someone asked, how do you do a podcast through your death?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:00:01" end="00:19:03:21" region="bottom">Well, I do have some residual hearing, so this</p>
      <p begin="00:19:04:04" end="00:19:08:00" region="bottom">monitors I have on my ears are jacked up to 10.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:08:00" end="00:19:09:23" region="bottom">They' as loud as they go.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:09:23" end="00:19:12:06" region="bottom">Plus, I have my hearing aids under these.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:12:06" end="00:19:14:11" region="bottom">So it's also being amplified.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:14:12" end="00:19:16:11" region="bottom">So that's how I do it.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:16:11" end="00:19:17:19" region="bottom">And then I rely on the captions on the screen.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:17:19" end="00:19:21:06" region="bottom">So any of my guests who don't speak slowly or clearly</p>
      <p begin="00:19:21:16" end="00:19:23:15" region="bottom">No.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:23:23" end="00:19:25:22" region="bottom">No, it's doing good with you, Brandon.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:25:22" end="00:19:28:12" region="bottom">It typically does good with you, but I have some friends that call.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:28:12" end="00:19:32:05" region="bottom">It just doesn't, it doesn't do well, which makes it impossible.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:32:05" end="00:19:36:19" region="bottom">Anyhow, so you got an engine, Chevy.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:36:20" end="00:19:38:19" region="bottom">You put it in here.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:38:19" end="00:19:39:20" region="bottom">You redid the harness.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:39:20" end="00:19:41:12" region="bottom">You said you're going to do aftermarket stuff</p>
      <p begin="00:19:41:22" end="00:19:44:06" region="bottom">You said you mentioned one of them, cruise control.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:44:08" end="00:19:46:07" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:46:07" end="00:19:48:19" region="bottom">So the engine I have is all electronically controlled.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:48:20" end="00:19:51:21" region="bottom">So the throttle the throttle controlled.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:51:21" end="00:19:53:20" region="bottom">Fly by wire?</p>
      <p begin="00:19:53:20" end="00:19:55:00" region="bottom">Let's drive by wire.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:55:00" end="00:19:56:18" region="bottom">So</p>
      <p begin="00:19:56:18" end="00:20:00:12" region="bottom">it's really easy to make those things work.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:01:01" end="00:20:03:00" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:03:00" end="00:20:05:01" region="bottom">I mean, you know, as well as I do in the tech field,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:05:02" end="00:20:09:12" region="bottom">adding more complexity to something makes it even worse when it breaks.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:11:03" end="00:20:15:00" region="bottom">So did this, this engine has ODB2 connection, right?</p>
      <p begin="00:20:15:06" end="00:20:17:05" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:17:05" end="00:20:17:20" region="bottom">Or is it OBD2?</p>
      <p begin="00:20:17:20" end="00:20:19:00" region="bottom">I don't, you know what I mean.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:19:00" end="00:20:20:02" region="bottom">So it does.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:20:02" end="00:20:21:10" region="bottom">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:21:10" end="00:20:22:02" region="bottom">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:22:02" end="00:20:22:18" region="bottom">So.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:22:18" end="00:20:27:14" region="bottom">I just have I just have a microphone slashcamera, potato combination.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:27:15" end="00:20:29:14" region="bottom">Potato combination</p>
      <p begin="00:20:31:00" end="00:20:32:23" region="bottom">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:32:23" end="00:20:34:12" region="bottom">So what are your plans?</p>
      <p begin="00:20:35:02" end="00:20:38:17" region="bottom">Do you have a date, like a rollout date, where wheels up, we're out?</p>
      <p begin="00:20:39:12" end="00:20:41:11" region="bottom">Wheels.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:41:11" end="00:20:43:03" region="bottom">Not specifically.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:43:03" end="00:20:44:16" region="bottom">We're hoping to get it done before winter.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:44:17" end="00:20:46:16" region="bottom">You know winter's here, right?</p>
      <p begin="00:20:46:16" end="00:20:48:09" region="bottom">It just snowed yesterday</p>
      <p begin="00:20:48:09" end="00:20:51:18" region="bottom">Yeah, but we we didn't originally plan to gut it all at once.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:51:18" end="00:20:54:22" region="bottom">We were just going to do the bedroom and then do the rest of overtime.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:55:05" end="00:20:57:04" region="bottom">Oh.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:57:04" end="00:20:58:00" region="bottom">But</p>
      <p begin="00:20:58:00" end="00:21:02:02" region="bottom">we found mice nest or a rat nest.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:02:02" end="00:21:04:01" region="bottom">So we're just like, well, we'll just gut it.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:04:06" end="00:21:06:05" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:06:05" end="00:21:09:19" region="bottom">And I'm I'm really glad we did because there there was a lot, there was a lot more.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:09:19" end="00:21:12:04" region="bottom">Found some things you didn't know were going to be there.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:12:19" end="00:21:14:18" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:14:18" end="00:21:17:10" region="bottom">That's the way it goes when you're working on something that's over 50 years old.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:17:10" end="00:21:21:03" region="bottom">Hell, working on anything nowadays,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:21:03" end="00:21:24:12" region="bottom">you'll find things that you did not expect to be in there and</p>
      <p begin="00:21:24:13" end="00:21:26:18" region="bottom">that most times shouldn't be in there.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:27:15" end="00:21:32:15" region="bottom">So is your plan, like, you don't really have a plan.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:32:16" end="00:21:35:14" region="bottom">You're just going to go do you?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:35:14" end="00:21:37:13" region="bottom">Or just drive the country?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:37:13" end="00:21:40:10" region="bottom">Do you have a route or are you just going to go south, north,heast, west, whatever.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:40:11" end="00:21:43:16" region="bottom">That's why it fits into me.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:43:16" end="00:21:45:15" region="bottom">No plan.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:45:15" end="00:21:46:08" region="bottom">Just go and see what happens.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:46:10" end="00:21:49:18" region="bottom">My manic episodes can now just be, hey, let's go to this city.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:49:19" end="00:21:51:18" region="bottom">That is so appealing to me.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:51:18" end="00:21:53:16" region="bottom">Like,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:54:10" end="00:21:56:09" region="bottom">and you'll still be able to work, right?</p>
      <p begin="00:21:56:09" end="00:21:58:01" region="bottom">Remotely with.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:58:01" end="00:22:00:15" region="bottom">Yeah, I'll have a Well, we have the TMobile</p>
      <p begin="00:22:00:15" end="00:22:05:23" region="bottom">5G. And we can just take it where we go and I can</p>
      <p begin="00:22:06:22" end="00:22:08:21" region="bottom">I can answer calls.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:08:21" end="00:22:10:15" region="bottom">It's not glamorous, but I can answer calls.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:10:22" end="00:22:14:09" region="bottom">I know quite a few people who in IT work</p>
      <p begin="00:22:14:09" end="00:22:18:02" region="bottom">remotely, who are a nomadic lifestyle.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:18:02" end="00:22:21:13" region="bottom">They you know, they have a home or they have a condo or something,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:21:13" end="00:22:24:17" region="bottom">but they prefer to spend the majority of their time traveling.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:24:18" end="00:22:27:20" region="bottom">Yeah. you meet new people</p>
      <p begin="00:22:27:20" end="00:22:29:22" region="bottom">and you get away from people you don't like</p>

      <p begin="00:23:15:08" end="00:23:17:17" region="bottom">I know there's other people out there that sounds appealing.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:17:17" end="00:23:20:09" region="bottom">And I'm sure there are people out there who think, I can't do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:20:10" end="00:23:22:13" region="bottom">I can't do that at this stage in my life.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:22:14" end="00:23:25:13" region="bottom">I'm too young or I'm too old or, well, I</p>

      <p begin="00:23:40:19" end="00:23:42:18" region="bottom">Dozens of dollars.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:42:18" end="00:23:44:03" region="bottom">Right, right.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:44:03" end="00:23:44:22" region="bottom">I mean, it costs more to</p>
      <p begin="00:23:45:01" end="00:23:48:13" region="bottom">file the taxes in an envelope than it does does to get back.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:48:14" end="00:23:51:06" region="bottom">Dozens of dollars.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:53:01" end="00:23:55:00" region="bottom">What's your plan?</p>
      <p begin="00:23:55:00" end="00:23:56:12" region="bottom">Do you have a plan for like income.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:56:12" end="00:23:59:07" region="bottom">You know, you got so you have your gas for the vehicle.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:59:08" end="00:24:01:07" region="bottom">You have insurance for the vehicle.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:01:07" end="00:24:03:12" region="bottom">You have whatever maintenance comes up.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:03:12" end="00:24:06:14" region="bottom">You have, you know, which is brakes, tires, oil,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:06:15" end="00:24:08:18" region="bottom">transmission fluid, belts</p>
      <p begin="00:24:09:09" end="00:24:12:12" region="bottom">um serpentine, you know, all these different expenses</p>
      <p begin="00:24:14:04" end="00:24:18:12" region="bottom">and you're in a, what, 30-some year old RV?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:19:06" end="00:24:22:06" region="bottom">52 Oh, sorry.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:22:07" end="00:24:24:06" region="bottom">What year is it?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:24:06" end="00:24:25:23" region="bottom">1972.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:25:23" end="00:24:27:04" region="bottom">72.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:27:04" end="00:24:28:10" region="bottom">Okay, okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:29:06" end="00:24:32:10" region="bottom">Yeah, so you have this old piece of ancient history that</p>
      <p begin="00:24:32:11" end="00:24:35:19" region="bottom">knock on wood could just fail at any moment.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:35:20" end="00:24:37:19" region="bottom">Do you have any plans for that?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:37:19" end="00:24:40:09" region="bottom">Like, I think, I feel like it would be a fun, cool thing, but like,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:40:09" end="00:24:42:14" region="bottom">what if it just breaks down, right?</p>
      <p begin="00:24:42:14" end="00:24:45:12" region="bottom">You blow a hose or something and you, you, it's no big deal.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:45:13" end="00:24:47:12" region="bottom">You don't need to find a hotel.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:47:12" end="00:24:48:17" region="bottom">You live in it</p>
      <p begin="00:24:49:06" end="00:24:53:11" region="bottom">Yeah, in most car issues, I can I can fix myself.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:53:18" end="00:24:57:14" region="bottom">Because I've been working on cars just about my whole life.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:57:14" end="00:25:00:15" region="bottom">Which is another plus is having the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:01:23" end="00:25:05:04" region="bottom">automotive electronic experience, the</p>
      <p begin="00:25:05:05" end="00:25:08:14" region="bottom">IT experience, all of that, mechanic experience experience is great</p>
      <p begin="00:25:08:15" end="00:25:10:17" region="bottom">for people who want to live on the road.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:11:05" end="00:25:16:03" region="bottom">For people who don't have those skill sets, but still</p>
      <p begin="00:25:16:17" end="00:25:20:01" region="bottom">want this nomadic life, well,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:20:01" end="00:25:23:10" region="bottom">like my partner, she is</p>
      <p begin="00:25:23:11" end="00:25:28:23" region="bottom">really into art and crocheting and those kinds of things.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:29:00" end="00:25:34:00" region="bottom">So what we're going to do with what she wants to do is start</p>
      <p begin="00:25:34:12" end="00:25:37:11" region="bottom">a a web store to</p>
      <p begin="00:25:37:12" end="00:25:40:10" region="bottom">complement her, because she goes to markets now.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:40:17" end="00:25:43:23" region="bottom">She's to compliment the market, she wants to start a YouTube channel</p>
      <p begin="00:25:43:23" end="00:25:47:10" region="bottom">and link her store to that so she</p>
      <p begin="00:25:47:11" end="00:25:50:10" region="bottom">can start selling her work to more people.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:52:10" end="00:25:54:09" region="bottom">So that's her plan.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:54:09" end="00:25:57:16" region="bottom">And then my plan is I, you know, I got this remote position.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:57:17" end="00:25:59:16" region="bottom">I can keep doing it.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:59:16" end="00:26:00:21" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:00:21" end="00:26:01:07" region="bottom">And I'm also</p>
      <p begin="00:26:01:10" end="00:26:03:10" region="bottom">able to do finished carpentry.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:03:11" end="00:26:06:23" region="bottom">So I I</p>
      <p begin="00:26:07:00" end="00:26:09:08" region="bottom">like to restore furniture and stuff and flip it.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:09:08" end="00:26:11:09" region="bottom">And then every once in a while I'll take a commission job.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:11:22" end="00:26:14:03" region="bottom">So are you going to have like a</p>
      <p begin="00:26:15:10" end="00:26:18:20" region="bottom">a website for yourself or for your</p>
      <p begin="00:26:18:21" end="00:26:22:08" region="bottom">brand of nomadic lifestyle so that like when you go places, you can</p>
      <p begin="00:26:22:08" end="00:26:24:15" region="bottom">set up side jobs to make a little money, right?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:25:03" end="00:26:27:02" region="bottom">Yeah, yeah, we can do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:27:02" end="00:26:31:04" region="bottom">I hadn't figured out the specifics on that part.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:31:05" end="00:26:33:04" region="bottom">For now, I'm just going to</p>
      <p begin="00:26:34:03" end="00:26:38:00" region="bottom">just lean on my current, just my</p>
      <p begin="00:26:40:02" end="00:26:42:01" region="bottom">shore income.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:42:01" end="00:26:43:00" region="bottom">Right, right, right, right, right.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:43:15" end="00:26:46:07" region="bottom">And then I also had a nest egg.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:46:08" end="00:26:48:07" region="bottom">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:48:07" end="00:26:49:20" region="bottom">Well, that's always good.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:51:03" end="00:26:53:02" region="bottom">Do you have any advice?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:53:02" end="00:26:57:02" region="bottom">We're not leaving, but do you have any advice for people who don't have these skill sets but still want this wife?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:57:02" end="00:26:59:08" region="bottom">Like someone who's like, oh, God, what if it breaks down?</p>
      <p begin="00:26:59:09" end="00:27:02:01" region="bottom">What if this happens to my, I don't know anything about this.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:02:02" end="00:27:04:01" region="bottom">What do I do?</p>
      <p begin="00:27:04:01" end="00:27:04:15" region="bottom">Any advice for people like that?</p>
      <p begin="00:27:05:08" end="00:27:08:08" region="bottom">I mean, just, just look for something that</p>
      <p begin="00:27:08:09" end="00:27:11:21" region="bottom">you can do remotely or, or</p>
      <p begin="00:27:11:22" end="00:27:15:22" region="bottom">find a hobby that you really like and and find a way to monetize it.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:15:22" end="00:27:17:21" region="bottom">No, no, no.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:17:21" end="00:27:20:05" region="bottom">I mean people who are committed to doing this nomadic</p>
      <p begin="00:27:20:06" end="00:27:24:03" region="bottom">lifestyle and traveling in an RV or converted bus or whatever they decide</p>
      <p begin="00:27:24:13" end="00:27:27:20" region="bottom">But they have no mechanical skills.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:27:20" end="00:27:30:13" region="bottom">They have nothing like that, like nothing.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:31:08" end="00:27:33:07" region="bottom">But they still want to do this.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:33:14" end="00:27:37:17" region="bottom">There's a lot of people in the van life community that have that problem.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:39:03" end="00:27:41:02" region="bottom">not a problem.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:41:02" end="00:27:42:11" region="bottom">It's just don't have that dealset.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:42:11" end="00:27:44:10" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:44:10" end="00:27:44:22" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:44:22" end="00:27:45:13" region="bottom">It's a problem that breaks down.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:45:14" end="00:27:47:13" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:47:13" end="00:27:48:11" region="bottom">Can be, yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:48:11" end="00:27:51:15" region="bottom">But they usually go and find like a</p>
      <p begin="00:27:52:07" end="00:27:54:20" region="bottom">a little bit newer of a vehicle.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:54:21" end="00:27:58:18" region="bottom">Okay, so you would recommend some newer.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:59:07" end="00:28:03:06" region="bottom">And then they also, you know, There's</p>
      <p begin="00:28:03:07" end="00:28:05:13" region="bottom">always mom and pop mechanics.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:06:01" end="00:28:08:00" region="bottom">What about insurance?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:08:00" end="00:28:11:16" region="bottom">Is it, you know, I need to talk to you about your expired car warranty.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:12:01" end="00:28:15:02" region="bottom">Well, with</p>
      <p begin="00:28:15:02" end="00:28:18:06" region="bottom">an RV, you can ensure it as an RV,</p>
      <p begin="00:28:18:19" end="00:28:22:00" region="bottom">which is a good amount cheaper.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:23:06" end="00:28:27:07" region="bottom">Does it cover everything inside of it or do you need renter's insurance?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:27:07" end="00:28:31:11" region="bottom">Like, I don't or like, how do you call owners insurance an RV?</p>
      <p begin="00:28:32:06" end="00:28:34:18" region="bottom">I think it just depends on the insurance plan.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:34:19" end="00:28:36:18" region="bottom">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:36:18" end="00:28:39:21" region="bottom">For us if we had it like</p>
      <p begin="00:28:39:22" end="00:28:42:08" region="bottom">burned to the ground for whatever reason.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:42:09" end="00:28:44:09" region="bottom">Knock on wood, not putting that out.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:44:09" end="00:28:46:08" region="bottom">I think we would probably just lose what's in it.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:47:12" end="00:28:49:11" region="bottom">But, you know, it's just stuff.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:50:12" end="00:28:52:11" region="bottom">Fair.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:52:11" end="00:28:53:10" region="bottom">It is just stuff.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:53:10" end="00:28:54:14" region="bottom">As long as the animals got out.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:54:14" end="00:28:56:13" region="bottom">And you guys.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:56:13" end="00:28:57:11" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:57:11" end="00:28:58:07" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58:07" end="00:28:58:17" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58:17" end="00:28:59:01" region="bottom">That's move. important.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:59:06" end="00:29:02:06" region="bottom">So you don't have, you, you</p>
      <p begin="00:29:02:06" end="00:29:05:13" region="bottom">don't have any plans or like a set, like, I want to</p>
      <p begin="00:29:05:13" end="00:29:08:17" region="bottom">go see the biggest ball with yarn or I want to go see the world's largest frying</p>
      <p begin="00:29:08:18" end="00:29:10:23" region="bottom">pan because that's something I would do.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:10:23" end="00:29:13:04" region="bottom">I would go travel to all those places</p>
      <p begin="00:29:13:20" end="00:29:18:00" region="bottom">We'll probably go to those places, but it'll just be, you know, whenever we want.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:18:01" end="00:29:20:00" region="bottom">Spontaneous, sporadic.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:20:00" end="00:29:21:16" region="bottom">Mostly.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:21:16" end="00:29:24:04" region="bottom">It's probably depend on what's making me manic at that moment.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:24:17" end="00:29:26:16" region="bottom">That's fair.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:26:16" end="00:29:29:16" region="bottom">And that full circle now, now we can go back into this,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:30:05" end="00:29:33:11" region="bottom">Wving your wife your life around around your mental health.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:33:12" end="00:29:36:05" region="bottom">So how often do you think you get manic?</p>
      <p begin="00:29:36:11" end="00:29:38:10" region="bottom">Or how often do you know you get manic?</p>
      <p begin="00:29:38:10" end="00:29:40:07" region="bottom">Sorry, not think?</p>
      <p begin="00:29:40:07" end="00:29:41:10" region="bottom">Every</p>
      <p begin="00:29:43:09" end="00:29:46:16" region="bottom">Probably around six to eight weeks.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:47:11" end="00:29:49:10" region="bottom">Sometimes a little more than that.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:49:10" end="00:29:51:22" region="bottom">Out of a year at once, consecutively.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:52:10" end="00:29:54:09" region="bottom">Oh, just</p>
      <p begin="00:29:54:09" end="00:29:56:03" region="bottom">between.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:56:03" end="00:29:57:14" region="bottom">Yeah, I think that was an underestimate now.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:57:14" end="00:30:00:16" region="bottom">But did you mean that, like, total in</p>
      <p begin="00:30:00:17" end="00:30:04:02" region="bottom">a year, you get manic about total time, six to eight weeks,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:04:03" end="00:30:06:19" region="bottom">or do you mean you stay manic for six to eight?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:06:19" end="00:30:08:18" region="bottom">weeks?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:08:18" end="00:30:11:20" region="bottom">Well, I was thinking about it, and I get</p>
      <p begin="00:30:11:20" end="00:30:17:09" region="bottom">manic probably four weeks from the last time ends.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:17:16" end="00:30:19:15" region="bottom">So time.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:21:04" end="00:30:24:23" region="bottom">So, like, let's say I have a manic episode that's two weeks long.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:24:23" end="00:30:28:01" region="bottom">I'll probably skip out until</p>
      <p begin="00:30:28:02" end="00:30:30:03" region="bottom">another four weeks after that..</p>
      <p begin="00:30:30:10" end="00:30:32:21" region="bottom">So it's like six weeks that way.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:33:20" end="00:30:37:15" region="bottom">So you have manic episodes that last two weeks, up to two weeks?</p>
      <p begin="00:30:38:09" end="00:30:40:08" region="bottom">Sometimes.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:40:08" end="00:30:41:20" region="bottom">Whoa.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:41:20" end="00:30:43:14" region="bottom">Oh, I've lost thousands</p>
      <p begin="00:30:43:15" end="00:30:45:15" region="bottom">of dollars to manicica.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:46:03" end="00:30:49:04" region="bottom">Wow, and that's very common, too.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:49:05" end="00:30:51:04" region="bottom">The people</p>
      <p begin="00:30:51:09" end="00:30:53:08" region="bottom">captions said mannequin.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:53:08" end="00:30:55:03" region="bottom">Good Lord.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:57:03" end="00:31:00:19" region="bottom">Yeah, I think I added it up in my head earlier,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:00:20" end="00:31:04:03" region="bottom">and I've lost about probably at least 20 grand.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:04:15" end="00:31:07:02" region="bottom">In the span of what time?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:07:15" end="00:31:12:08" region="bottom">Since I was, I think around 25.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:12:21" end="00:31:14:20" region="bottom">25?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:14:20" end="00:31:16:14" region="bottom">So 7 years years?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:16:14" end="00:31:18:13" region="bottom">No.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:18:13" end="00:31:19:02" region="bottom">Eight years?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:19:02" end="00:31:20:01" region="bottom">Getting old.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:20:16" end="00:31:22:15" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:22:15" end="00:31:23:15" region="bottom">Eight years.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:23:15" end="00:31:27:21" region="bottom">So what is what does mania look like for you?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:27:22" end="00:31:29:22" region="bottom">Is it the same every time?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:29:23" end="00:31:31:22" region="bottom">Or is it.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:31:22" end="00:31:34:15" region="bottom">Sometimes I like one time I went on a minimal minimalist</p>
      <p begin="00:31:34:15" end="00:31:38:02" region="bottom">kick and I threw just about all my belongings away</p>
      <p begin="00:31:39:14" end="00:31:41:19" region="bottom">And that went well.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:42:08" end="00:31:45:01" region="bottom">Did it?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:45:01" end="00:31:47:00" region="bottom">Did it go well?</p>
      <p begin="00:31:47:00" end="00:31:49:06" region="bottom">And then, I mean, I bought, I purchased like</p>
      <p begin="00:31:50:08" end="00:31:54:12" region="bottom">so many project vehicles during manic episodes.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:54:13" end="00:31:56:19" region="bottom">There's only one of them I don't regret.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:57:04" end="00:31:59:03" region="bottom">And that's, that's the Jeep.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:59:03" end="00:32:00:15" region="bottom">The Jeep.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:00:15" end="00:32:01:05" region="bottom">I knew you were going to say The Jeep.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:02:13" end="00:32:04:12" region="bottom">The Jeep.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:04:12" end="00:32:05:18" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:05:18" end="00:32:07:07" region="bottom">The one manic episode that paid off in the longer end.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:09:07" end="00:32:11:06" region="bottom">Wow.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:11:06" end="00:32:11:08" region="bottom">So is it.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:11:08" end="00:32:14:15" region="bottom">Is it kind of like a retail therapy when you're manic?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:14:16" end="00:32:17:19" region="bottom">Or do you do retail therapy even when you're not manic?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:18:13" end="00:32:20:17" region="bottom">It's not really retail therapy.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:20:17" end="00:32:23:19" region="bottom">I get obsessed with like a certain thing or</p>
      <p begin="00:32:23:20" end="00:32:26:06" region="bottom">a certain hobby or a certain.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:27:07" end="00:32:29:06" region="bottom">And I</p>
      <p begin="00:32:29:13" end="00:32:32:14" region="bottom">I just go all in and then I want to get the best</p>
      <p begin="00:32:32:14" end="00:32:36:18" region="bottom">of the best and I buy it, and then I use it for like a week.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:37:19" end="00:32:40:03" region="bottom">Or I stay excited about it for a week.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:40:03" end="00:32:42:02" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:42:02" end="00:32:45:13" region="bottom">And that's once again, at my hand, it's like, oh, yeah, who cares?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:45:14" end="00:32:47:13" region="bottom">Do what?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:47:13" end="00:32:48:08" region="bottom">And that's the mania for you?</p>
      <p begin="00:32:48:12" end="00:32:51:12" region="bottom">Sometimes, sometimes I just go like on a</p>
      <p begin="00:32:51:13" end="00:32:54:21" region="bottom">crazy cleaning spree where I'll pull everything</p>
      <p begin="00:32:54:21" end="00:32:57:10" region="bottom">out of the drawers and organize everything.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:57:11" end="00:32:59:10" region="bottom">And</p>
      <p begin="00:32:59:10" end="00:33:00:18" region="bottom">it really.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:00:18" end="00:33:01:11" region="bottom">And you would.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:01:11" end="00:33:03:08" region="bottom">I'm sorry, it depends.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:03:08" end="00:33:05:07" region="bottom">And you attribute this to</p>
      <p begin="00:33:07:00" end="00:33:11:23" region="bottom">Manic episodes, the bipolar, and not, say, ADHD or autism?</p>
      <p begin="00:33:13:00" end="00:33:15:06" region="bottom">Or a combination of all three.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:15:06" end="00:33:17:06" region="bottom">My therapist thinks it's</p>
      <p begin="00:33:18:06" end="00:33:21:14" region="bottom">from bipolar, but also like CPTSD</p>
      <p begin="00:33:21:15" end="00:33:23:23" region="bottom">has very similar symptoms.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:24:11" end="00:33:26:10" region="bottom">Avo.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:26:17" end="00:33:30:04" region="bottom">And then I'm just kind of realizing here recently,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:30:05" end="00:33:32:15" region="bottom">enough people have mentioned it to me.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:32:16" end="00:33:34:17" region="bottom">I didn't realize I might be autistic.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:37:05" end="00:33:39:15" region="bottom">See, everybody else seems to know.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:39:16" end="00:33:42:15" region="bottom">I mean, everyone else seemed to know about me as</p>
      <p begin="00:33:42:16" end="00:33:45:08" region="bottom">well until, you know, a diagnosis.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:45:08" end="00:33:48:09" region="bottom">Yeah, you're so autistic, Brandon.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:49:05" end="00:33:51:05" region="bottom">You are like hardcore.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:54:03" end="00:33:58:20" region="bottom">A lot of people I know are, and it's funny that the people, like you say, keep good people in your life.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:58:20" end="00:34:01:22" region="bottom">Those are the good people that are in my life,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:01:23" end="00:34:05:04" region="bottom">the ones that kind of think like me or at the very least</p>
      <p begin="00:34:05:05" end="00:34:07:21" region="bottom">understand how I think..</p>
      <p begin="00:34:07:21" end="00:34:11:08" region="bottom">And you, you said that., I think I just said that keep</p>
      <p begin="00:34:11:09" end="00:34:13:11" region="bottom">the people, the good people in your life.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:13:11" end="00:34:16:06" region="bottom">Yeah, you know, the people who bring positivity</p>
      <p begin="00:34:16:22" end="00:34:18:21" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:18:21" end="00:34:21:03" region="bottom">And that you can confide in.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:21:22" end="00:34:23:21" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:23:21" end="00:34:25:16" region="bottom">Someone you can trust and that you can, right, right, right, right.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:25:17" end="00:34:29:08" region="bottom">And I was actually talking today, like, when is</p>
      <p begin="00:34:30:04" end="00:34:34:15" region="bottom">talking about something become complaining about something?</p>
      <p begin="00:34:34:15" end="00:34:37:14" region="bottom">And as an example, I was talking about this morning</p>
      <p begin="00:34:37:15" end="00:34:42:21" region="bottom">we were talking about hearing and how there are some days</p>
      <p begin="00:34:43:16" end="00:34:46:15" region="bottom">like today, you know, I just</p>
      <p begin="00:34:46:16" end="00:34:49:23" region="bottom">cried most of today because I was</p>
      <p begin="00:34:49:23" end="00:34:53:01" region="bottom">trying to listen to some music and I was then I was</p>
      <p begin="00:34:53:02" end="00:34:58:03" region="bottom">going to try to work on a song on, well, a few songs I was composing before all this fun shit happened.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:58:22" end="00:35:00:21" region="bottom">But it doesn't sound the same to me.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:00:21" end="00:35:02:14" region="bottom">It's not.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:04:07" end="00:35:06:06" region="bottom">It's just not the same.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:06:06" end="00:35:09:00" region="bottom">And most days, I'm just like, oh, well, I mean, this is it.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:09:01" end="00:35:11:00" region="bottom">Radical acceptance, right?</p>
      <p begin="00:35:11:00" end="00:35:12:04" region="bottom">This is your life now.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:12:04" end="00:35:16:05" region="bottom">But then there are some days like today where I can't block, you know, the thoughts.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:16:05" end="00:35:18:04" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:18:04" end="00:35:20:02" region="bottom">And I just, what can you do?</p>
      <p begin="00:35:20:02" end="00:35:21:16" region="bottom">Right?</p>
      <p begin="00:35:21:16" end="00:35:21:22" region="bottom">So I just go with it.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:21:22" end="00:35:22:23" region="bottom">I'm not fighting it anymore.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:22:23" end="00:35:24:09" region="bottom">So I just sat here and cried.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:24:09" end="00:35:25:20" region="bottom">That's all I did.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:25:20" end="00:35:28:02" region="bottom">We sat right here in this chair and fucking cried.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:28:14" end="00:35:33:18" region="bottom">Um, with music blasting in my monitors and my hearing aids trying to</p>
      <p begin="00:35:35:02" end="00:35:39:13" region="bottom">get back a feeling of the times when it was like normal, so to speak.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:42:07" end="00:35:44:12" region="bottom">Yeah, so we were talking about that.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:44:12" end="00:35:46:11" region="bottom">And I'm like...</p>
      <p begin="00:35:48:10" end="00:35:50:09" region="bottom">Who do I talk to this about?</p>
      <p begin="00:35:50:09" end="00:35:52:07" region="bottom">Everyone I know already knows.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:52:07" end="00:35:54:06" region="bottom">Like everyone I know knows about this.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:54:06" end="00:35:57:01" region="bottom">So if I talk about it every day to get it off my</p>
      <p begin="00:35:57:01" end="00:35:59:20" region="bottom">chest, when is it complaining?</p>
      <p begin="00:35:59:21" end="00:36:02:22" region="bottom">And like, I'm always afraid someone's going to be like, oh, there's Christopher.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:02:22" end="00:36:04:21" region="bottom">He's complaining again.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:04:21" end="00:36:05:11" region="bottom">And about, you know, he's hearing.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:06:08" end="00:36:09:08" region="bottom">I would say complaining starts when you</p>
      <p begin="00:36:09:08" end="00:36:13:01" region="bottom">have control over the situation, or</p>
      <p begin="00:36:13:01" end="00:36:15:01" region="bottom">at least some control over the situation.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:15:07" end="00:36:17:06" region="bottom">In my own.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:17:06" end="00:36:18:06" region="bottom">Explain that.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:18:06" end="00:36:20:06" region="bottom">So, like, you're hearing loss.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:20:07" end="00:36:22:06" region="bottom">You have no control over that.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:22:07" end="00:36:24:06" region="bottom">There's nothing you can do about it.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:24:06" end="00:36:26:06" region="bottom">It's just a huge impact on your life right now.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:26:13" end="00:36:28:12" region="bottom">And in the future</p>
      <p begin="00:36:28:12" end="00:36:29:18" region="bottom">I mean.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:29:18" end="00:36:32:00" region="bottom">As a classical piano for 40 years, yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:32:07" end="00:36:37:02" region="bottom">I mean, I would expect you to be upset and I wouldn't classify that as complaining.</p>

      <p begin="00:36:39:13" end="00:36:41:12" region="bottom">Yeah, well, I know.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:41:12" end="00:36:43:06" region="bottom">It's, it's like,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:44:07" end="00:36:46:06" region="bottom">There are no words.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:46:06" end="00:36:48:22" region="bottom">I can't find a word to mean how I feel.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:48:23" end="00:36:51:00" region="bottom">But I I mean, it ruins your life.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:51:18" end="00:36:54:04" region="bottom">The way you are with music.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:54:05" end="00:36:57:23" region="bottom">It just, it ruins what you mean as life.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:58:00" end="00:37:02:19" region="bottom">My identity for 40 years was piano, piano, piano, piano, piano, piano, piano, piano</p>
      <p begin="00:37:03:12" end="00:37:06:16" region="bottom">And that's why I wouldn't classify it as</p>
      <p begin="00:37:06:17" end="00:37:10:13" region="bottom">a complaint as more of it's like like a</p>
      <p begin="00:37:10:13" end="00:37:12:23" region="bottom">huge issue you're dealing dealing with.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:13:00" end="00:37:15:23" region="bottom">But how do you talk to this do you talk</p>
      <p begin="00:37:16:00" end="00:37:18:18" region="bottom">about this so that you're getting it out?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:20:06" end="00:37:23:10" region="bottom">Because it affects you every day, every second</p>
      <p begin="00:37:23:10" end="00:37:26:21" region="bottom">that I'm awayake, how do you get this</p>
      <p begin="00:37:26:21" end="00:37:30:06" region="bottom">out and process it without sounding like you're</p>
      <p begin="00:37:30:07" end="00:37:34:05" region="bottom">just complaining about the same thing over and over again?</p>
      <p begin="00:37:34:06" end="00:37:36:22" region="bottom">Because, right, it's always going to be about the same thing that's</p>
      <p begin="00:37:37:23" end="00:37:39:22" region="bottom">consuming..</p>
      <p begin="00:37:40:05" end="00:37:43:13" region="bottom">It's why there's two or three people are important because</p>
      <p begin="00:37:43:13" end="00:37:47:20" region="bottom">like if you talk to me about it, I'm never going to think to just complainingaining.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:47:21" end="00:37:49:20" region="bottom">It's, you.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:49:20" end="00:37:51:18" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:51:18" end="00:37:52:22" region="bottom">It's huge.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:52:23" end="00:37:54:22" region="bottom">It is.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:54:22" end="00:37:57:21" region="bottom">And when I'm told to talk about it, I</p>
      <p begin="00:37:57:21" end="00:38:00:23" region="bottom">don't know what to talk about, if that makes sense.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:01:00" end="00:38:03:21" region="bottom">Like, I don't, like, what do I say?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:03:21" end="00:38:07:05" region="bottom">Okay, mers, the tinitis is so loud.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:07:06" end="00:38:09:05" region="bottom">I can't really hear anything else.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:09:15" end="00:38:12:19" region="bottom">Then it drops again, and then I had to get new hearing</p>
      <p begin="00:38:12:19" end="00:38:16:12" region="bottom">aids, and now music is like not even existing in my life anymore.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:16:13" end="00:38:20:09" region="bottom">What do you say and to talk about it when people already know?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:20:09" end="00:38:23:18" region="bottom">I mean, and that, anything mental health that</p>
      <p begin="00:38:23:19" end="00:38:27:10" region="bottom">somebody may know about you, how do you talk about it without it</p>
      <p begin="00:38:28:04" end="00:38:30:15" region="bottom">coming off that you're just complaining?</p>
      <p begin="00:38:32:10" end="00:38:34:09" region="bottom">It's really a great area.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:34:09" end="00:38:36:02" region="bottom">It's hard.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:36:02" end="00:38:39:10" region="bottom">And Don Yars even said it today,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:40:16" end="00:38:42:15" region="bottom">it depends on the person you're talking to.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:42:15" end="00:38:44:08" region="bottom">You know, if they're taking it that way.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:44:08" end="00:38:46:14" region="bottom">He's like, it just depends.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:46:15" end="00:38:49:15" region="bottom">And you can't really, you can't control how someone takes something.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:50:10" end="00:38:54:02" region="bottom">You can clarify before you say something, like pre</p>
      <p begin="00:38:54:17" end="00:38:57:01" region="bottom">or you can clarify after you say something.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:57:01" end="00:39:01:21" region="bottom">But in that moment, there's no way someone's just going to perceive what they perceive.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:02:03" end="00:39:05:11" region="bottom">Yeah, and like when I have some</p>
      <p begin="00:39:05:12" end="00:39:08:21" region="bottom">kind of trigger, well, triggers a strong word.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:08:22" end="00:39:10:21" region="bottom">When I have something that really</p>
      <p begin="00:39:11:15" end="00:39:15:14" region="bottom">makes me remember things from my past that were challenging.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:16:21" end="00:39:20:04" region="bottom">I mean, my response to that, I don't think would be a complaint.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:20:04" end="00:39:22:03" region="bottom">It would just be</p>
      <p begin="00:39:22:03" end="00:39:26:08" region="bottom">something that I like, I don't have a lot of control over how I feel.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:27:09" end="00:39:32:14" region="bottom">I mean, we do, but also there's there's circumstances that we have no control over.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:33:03" end="00:39:35:02" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:35:02" end="00:39:36:03" region="bottom">That's where radical acceptance comes into play.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:36:03" end="00:39:40:07" region="bottom">You started to say trigger and then said, no, why did you change it?</p>
      <p begin="00:39:41:02" end="00:39:43:01" region="bottom">Well, I don't..</p>
      <p begin="00:39:44:14" end="00:39:46:13" region="bottom">I feel like trigger is something..</p>
      <p begin="00:39:48:00" end="00:39:49:23" region="bottom">I don't know.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:49:23" end="00:39:50:09" region="bottom">I like I don't like the.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:51:02" end="00:39:53:04" region="bottom">I guess I don't enjoy or I don't like</p>
      <p begin="00:39:54:02" end="00:39:58:07" region="bottom">the concept of triggers.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:58:07" end="00:40:01:18" region="bottom">I feel like that puts a taboo on some things.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:01:19" end="00:40:06:06" region="bottom">You know, if you're going to get emotional, it's going to happen.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:06:07" end="00:40:09:16" region="bottom">If you don't want to be emotional, then I don't know.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:09:17" end="00:40:11:16" region="bottom">But</p>
      <p begin="00:40:11:16" end="00:40:13:23" region="bottom">Well, I think in the context of mental health, trigger means</p>
      <p begin="00:40:13:23" end="00:40:20:01" region="bottom">a specific thing that breaks up a traumatic.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:20:07" end="00:40:23:11" region="bottom">I guess the way I think about it is that</p>
      <p begin="00:40:23:11" end="00:40:27:21" region="bottom">I don't mind triggers because it makes me communicate</p>
      <p begin="00:40:27:22" end="00:40:30:01" region="bottom">things and de-stigmatize things</p>
      <p begin="00:40:30:13" end="00:40:32:12" region="bottom">from my past.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:32:12" end="00:40:35:08" region="bottom">I don't, I feel like there's a stigma in</p>
      <p begin="00:40:35:08" end="00:40:39:18" region="bottom">being a victim a lot of times in cases of abuse and such like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:42:01" end="00:40:46:22" region="bottom">And I just, I just don't like people walking on the eggs shoulders around me.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:46:22" end="00:40:48:21" region="bottom">If it happens, it happens kind of thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:48:21" end="00:40:50:20" region="bottom">So I guess they could still be considered triggers.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50:21" end="00:40:53:20" region="bottom">I just don't I don't view it as a</p>
      <p begin="00:40:53:21" end="00:40:57:22" region="bottom">thing to hold me down or view it as a thing that I get to communicate to people</p>
      <p begin="00:40:58:18" end="00:41:00:17" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:00:17" end="00:41:03:07" region="bottom">That's a good way of reframing that.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:03:08" end="00:41:05:07" region="bottom">Wow.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:05:20" end="00:41:08:01" region="bottom">Hmm.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:08:06" end="00:41:10:05" region="bottom">Yeah, I still call them triggers.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:13:12" end="00:41:16:17" region="bottom">But I never really put it any thought into the actual word.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:17:07" end="00:41:21:14" region="bottom">I guess I see triggers and opportunities.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:21:15" end="00:41:23:14" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:24:00" end="00:41:25:23" region="bottom">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:26:08" end="00:41:28:07" region="bottom">Triggers as opportunities.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:29:12" end="00:41:32:14" region="bottom">Yeah, when I, something triggers and I have a panic</p>
      <p begin="00:41:32:14" end="00:41:37:17" region="bottom">attack, first thing I think of is not, oh, here's an opportunity to figure out what happened.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:37:18" end="00:41:41:16" region="bottom">Nope, that's not what happens when you have a panic attack, unfortunately</p>
      <p begin="00:41:42:17" end="00:41:44:16" region="bottom">But that's interesting.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:44:17" end="00:41:49:23" region="bottom">A trigger has a room for room to whatever you said.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:50:05" end="00:41:52:04" region="bottom">It's a room for</p>
      <p begin="00:41:52:17" end="00:41:54:23" region="bottom">it's room for understanding..</p>
      <p begin="00:41:55:00" end="00:41:56:23" region="bottom">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:56:23" end="00:41:58:17" region="bottom">You know, it's like you're going to have a</p>
      <p begin="00:41:58:17" end="00:42:02:07" region="bottom">visceral visceral reaction oftentimes with</p>
      <p begin="00:42:02:08" end="00:42:04:13" region="bottom">a trigger, but I don't know.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:04:13" end="00:42:06:12" region="bottom">I just don't view that as</p>
      <p begin="00:42:06:23" end="00:42:08:22" region="bottom">a thing I want to avoid.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:08:22" end="00:42:10:09" region="bottom">I view it as a thing that I want to..</p>
      <p begin="00:42:11:00" end="00:42:12:23" region="bottom">Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:12:23" end="00:42:13:12" region="bottom">No way. portray</p>
      <p begin="00:42:16:01" end="00:42:18:00" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:18:00" end="00:42:20:21" region="bottom">It's you want to work through them because</p>
      <p begin="00:42:20:22" end="00:42:25:07" region="bottom">you want to identify them so that they don't become triggers anymore.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:25:07" end="00:42:27:06" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:29:17" end="00:42:31:16" region="bottom">It's complicated.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:31:16" end="00:42:32:18" region="bottom">I mean.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:32:18" end="00:42:33:03" region="bottom">It is.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:33:03" end="00:42:33:14" region="bottom">No, it is.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:33:14" end="00:42:36:01" region="bottom">I mean, some people avoid trigers like to play.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:36:02" end="00:42:38:01" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:38:01" end="00:42:40:00" region="bottom">I just want people to be just to be around me.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:40:00" end="00:42:41:23" region="bottom">I don't want or like to be themselves.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:41:23" end="00:42:44:11" region="bottom">And I don't want them to walk on eggshells because they might</p>
      <p begin="00:42:44:18" end="00:42:46:17" region="bottom">trigger me.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:46:17" end="00:42:48:11" region="bottom">Well, but that's part of life.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:48:11" end="00:42:51:15" region="bottom">Like, we can't tell everyone we know, hey, these are my triggers.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:51:16" end="00:42:55:04" region="bottom">And you can't tell everyone you interact with that.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:55:10" end="00:42:59:15" region="bottom">Maybe you're close or a friend, you know, those people you were talking about.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:59:22" end="00:43:03:18" region="bottom">But once you get really good at reframing things in your mind</p>
      <p begin="00:43:04:11" end="00:43:06:20" region="bottom">triggers become different, I guess.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:06:21" end="00:43:08:20" region="bottom">No, no, no.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:08:20" end="00:43:10:01" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:10:01" end="00:43:10:08" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:10:08" end="00:43:12:21" region="bottom">I never thought about reframing a trigger once</p>
      <p begin="00:43:12:22" end="00:43:17:21" region="bottom">you identify it to help lessen it and make it not a trigger anymore.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:17:22" end="00:43:19:21" region="bottom">Never thought about that.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:19:21" end="00:43:21:11" region="bottom">Because I do.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:21:11" end="00:43:22:03" region="bottom">I have learned to read.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:22:03" end="00:43:23:12" region="bottom">I'm sorry, what?</p>
      <p begin="00:43:23:12" end="00:43:25:12" region="bottom">It could still be a trigger, but it trigger</p>
      <p begin="00:43:25:12" end="00:43:27:12" region="bottom">a different response.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:27:13" end="00:43:29:12" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:29:12" end="00:43:31:23" region="bottom">The analogy I use, I don't know why.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:32:00" end="00:43:35:15" region="bottom">because you can physically rewire your brain.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:35:15" end="00:43:39:13" region="bottom">You can make new new pathways and CBT</p>
      <p begin="00:43:40:12" end="00:43:42:11" region="bottom">DBT.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:42:11" end="00:43:46:15" region="bottom">I mean, I haven't done that before, so it's, yeah,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:46:15" end="00:43:49:10" region="bottom">that's what I've been doing for decades.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:49:10" end="00:43:54:02" region="bottom">The analogy I use is when I had a trigger</p>
      <p begin="00:43:55:02" end="00:43:59:16" region="bottom">um, you know, I'm, I'm I I'm in a car.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:59:16" end="00:44:03:04" region="bottom">I'm driving down the interstate freeway, whatever you want.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:03:05" end="00:44:05:04" region="bottom">I'm on the 405, okay?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:05:04" end="00:44:06:18" region="bottom">I'm in I'm in LA County.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:06:18" end="00:44:08:04" region="bottom">I'm driving on the 405.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:08:04" end="00:44:12:01" region="bottom">Something triggers me.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:13:08" end="00:44:15:13" region="bottom">I figure out what the trigger is.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:19:02" end="00:44:24:01" region="bottom">I love when I lose my train of thought right in the middle of a good fucking sentence.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:25:14" end="00:44:27:13" region="bottom">Going down there.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:27:13" end="00:44:28:09" region="bottom">What are you just talking about.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:28:09" end="00:44:30:06" region="bottom">Going down the 405, something triggers you.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:30:06" end="00:44:35:02" region="bottom">Right, but before that, I need to get led back into what I was thinking, and I can't scroll in the captions.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:35:02" end="00:44:37:01" region="bottom">Thank you, Zoom</p>
      <p begin="00:44:37:01" end="00:44:38:05" region="bottom">So..</p>
      <p begin="00:44:38:05" end="00:44:39:13" region="bottom">I think.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:40:07" end="00:44:42:06" region="bottom">What were we talking about?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:42:06" end="00:44:43:06" region="bottom">Is a problem?</p>
      <p begin="00:44:43:06" end="00:44:44:05" region="bottom">We both do this.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:44:05" end="00:44:45:01" region="bottom">I know.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:45:01" end="00:44:45:19" region="bottom">We were talking about triggers.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:47:19" end="00:44:49:23" region="bottom">Going on the road on the 405.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:49:23" end="00:44:51:22" region="bottom">Oh, yes, my analogy.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:51:22" end="00:44:54:22" region="bottom">So I have a trigger trigger triggers me in the past.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:54:23" end="00:44:56:22" region="bottom">I would immediately take the exit.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:56:22" end="00:44:58:14" region="bottom">That's my exit.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:58:14" end="00:44:59:13" region="bottom">Here's the trigger.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:59:13" end="00:45:00:06" region="bottom">Here's the trauma.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:00:06" end="00:45:00:23" region="bottom">Here's my exit.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:00:23" end="00:45:01:18" region="bottom">This is familiar.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:01:18" end="00:45:02:14" region="bottom">This is what I'm used to.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:02:14" end="00:45:03:16" region="bottom">I'm here now.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:03:16" end="00:45:04:20" region="bottom">Yay</p>
      <p begin="00:45:04:20" end="00:45:07:18" region="bottom">What happens now, the</p>
      <p begin="00:45:07:19" end="00:45:11:17" region="bottom">ones that I have identified, I'll be driving down the 405.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:11:17" end="00:45:14:08" region="bottom">Oh, oh, look, there's that exit.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:14:09" end="00:45:17:00" region="bottom">Yeah, that was a fucking horrible time.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:17:00" end="00:45:19:18" region="bottom">And then I just keep driving, drive right past it.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:20:18" end="00:45:23:23" region="bottom">I think it is important to know for</p>
      <p begin="00:45:24:23" end="00:45:28:10" region="bottom">me, I don't know if this is everybody, for me, even</p>
      <p begin="00:45:28:11" end="00:45:32:11" region="bottom">after you learn the trigger, even after you have worked through it</p>
      <p begin="00:45:33:06" end="00:45:37:23" region="bottom">and have created that new pathway, the trigger is still there.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:38:12" end="00:45:40:11" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:40:11" end="00:45:41:08" region="bottom">Oh, no, the only can be there.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:41:08" end="00:45:43:07" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:43:07" end="00:45:43:19" region="bottom">The memory is there.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:43:19" end="00:45:45:14" region="bottom">It's always going to be there.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:45:14" end="00:45:47:13" region="bottom">And, and</p>
      <p begin="00:45:47:13" end="00:45:51:00" region="bottom">maybe that might be what confuses or turns people away</p>
      <p begin="00:45:51:00" end="00:45:54:07" region="bottom">is when they hear, you know, oh, you'll heal.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:54:07" end="00:45:56:06" region="bottom">You'll get through this and you'll just heal.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:56:11" end="00:45:58:14" region="bottom">You might get better.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:58:14" end="00:46:01:11" region="bottom">You might, you might, you might not.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:01:11" end="00:46:04:10" region="bottom">But that memory is never going to go</p>
      <p begin="00:46:04:11" end="00:46:07:20" region="bottom">away, but how you react to it is what changes.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:07:21" end="00:46:09:23" region="bottom">So I'm driving down this the 405</p>
      <p begin="00:46:10:07" end="00:46:12:11" region="bottom">trigger, gross.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:12:17" end="00:46:14:16" region="bottom">Well, I have a new pathway in my head.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:14:16" end="00:46:18:21" region="bottom">Okay, well, that happened, but it doesn't really bother me anymore because that was forever ago.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:18:21" end="00:46:20:20" region="bottom">Keep driving.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:20:20" end="00:46:22:04" region="bottom">Right path.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:22:04" end="00:46:26:21" region="bottom">I've heard a metaphor from a couple from a YouTuber, I've really used to follow a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:46:27:09" end="00:46:30:10" region="bottom">So like things in your past are like</p>
      <p begin="00:46:30:10" end="00:46:35:04" region="bottom">like a scar on a tree, like if you carve your name into it or whatever.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:35:16" end="00:46:38:15" region="bottom">Those things, they're not going to get smaller.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:38:23" end="00:46:41:12" region="bottom">They're going to stay in about the same place</p>
      <p begin="00:46:42:04" end="00:46:45:02" region="bottom">and the same size, but the tree will get bigger.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:45:03" end="00:46:47:02" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:47:02" end="00:46:48:17" region="bottom">So, like, they might seem big, but</p>
      <p begin="00:46:48:17" end="00:46:51:21" region="bottom">as you grow, those things are the</p>
      <p begin="00:46:51:21" end="00:46:56:09" region="bottom">same size of smaller compared to your life experiences.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:57:10" end="00:46:59:09" region="bottom">That's a good analogy.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:02:16" end="00:47:05:20" region="bottom">Okay, so you herd a tree and you carve</p>
      <p begin="00:47:05:20" end="00:47:07:21" region="bottom">your name, you carve something into it.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:09:22" end="00:47:12:09" region="bottom">The tree is just going to grow straight up.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:12:22" end="00:47:16:09" region="bottom">Yeah, and that thing is going to stay in roughly the same spot.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:16:21" end="00:47:21:00" region="bottom">Well, I mean, it's going to grow with it, right?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:21:00" end="00:47:22:23" region="bottom">Won't it move up as the tree grows?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:22:23" end="00:47:27:11" region="bottom">I guess depending on the age of the tree and where you put it, sure, that place into this, I guess</p>
      <p begin="00:47:27:23" end="00:47:30:22" region="bottom">But yeah, I mean, if it's an established tree,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:30:23" end="00:47:33:02" region="bottom">yes, it's just going to pretty much stay where it is.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:33:09" end="00:47:37:14" region="bottom">But the tree evolves and gets bigger and gets stronger,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:37:15" end="00:47:41:06" region="bottom">you know, better footing, reach for that light.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:41:07" end="00:47:44:08" region="bottom">And then, boom, beautiful, strong tree.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:46:15" end="00:47:50:02" region="bottom">That metaphor</p>
      <p begin="00:47:50:02" end="00:47:54:00" region="bottom">just really has helped me in a lot of a lot of saying it.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:54:01" end="00:47:56:08" region="bottom">It's just a helpful metaphor for my mental health.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:57:20" end="00:47:59:19" region="bottom">And what do you do, visualize it?</p>
      <p begin="00:47:59:19" end="00:48:02:17" region="bottom">Like, does something pop in your head and you're like, oh, I need to, let me</p>
      <p begin="00:48:02:18" end="00:48:05:06" region="bottom">ground real quick and go, you fall back on that?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:05:06" end="00:48:07:15" region="bottom">It's not really a visualized thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:07:16" end="00:48:12:06" region="bottom">It's more, it is a grounding thing, but it's just a remembering</p>
      <p begin="00:48:13:20" end="00:48:15:19" region="bottom">Just.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:15:19" end="00:48:16:22" region="bottom">Be mindful.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:16:22" end="00:48:19:00" region="bottom">I mean, I hate that word, but Jesus, yeah, just being mindful</p>
      <p begin="00:48:19:01" end="00:48:22:08" region="bottom">in the in the moment, in the present.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:24:08" end="00:48:29:08" region="bottom">Okay, so you get manic for a week or two.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:29:08" end="00:48:31:07" region="bottom">You're out on the road.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:32:14" end="00:48:35:18" region="bottom">Are you worried about your nest egg and</p>
      <p begin="00:48:37:01" end="00:48:39:00" region="bottom">manic draining your bank account?</p>
      <p begin="00:48:39:19" end="00:48:41:18" region="bottom">I won't.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:41:18" end="00:48:44:03" region="bottom">It won't be as easy for me because I won't be able to</p>
      <p begin="00:48:44:04" end="00:48:47:19" region="bottom">just buy things in California and have a place to put them.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:48:21" end="00:48:51:06" region="bottom">Oh, that's fair, because now that you're..</p>
      <p begin="00:48:52:01" end="00:48:54:00" region="bottom">Oh, I didn't even think about that.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:54:00" end="00:48:57:23" region="bottom">Things you start collecting a lot. along the way, you're going to need to drop off somewhere.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:57:23" end="00:49:03:07" region="bottom">And if I' if I'm in like California or somewhere, anywhere out west,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:04:00" end="00:49:09:06" region="bottom">or even anywhere on the East Coast, it's it's just not a really good deal on a Jeep.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:10:07" end="00:49:12:06" region="bottom">I'll have to pass it.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:13:08" end="00:49:16:19" region="bottom">Or tow it behind you and convert it as an</p>
      <p begin="00:49:16:20" end="00:49:20:05" region="bottom">add-on bedroom to your RV.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:20:06" end="00:49:23:00" region="bottom">I think Dell's going to need to have a word with you.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:24:03" end="00:49:26:02" region="bottom">Why?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:27:03" end="00:49:29:06" region="bottom">Why would she have to have a word with me?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:29:12" end="00:49:31:11" region="bottom">You might be encouraging.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:32:03" end="00:49:34:18" region="bottom">Is it the bad things that I do?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:35:20" end="00:49:37:19" region="bottom">I mean, I guess not bad, but...</p>
      <p begin="00:49:38:05" end="00:49:40:04" region="bottom">Yeah, when people have..</p>
      <p begin="00:49:40:04" end="00:49:41:22" region="bottom">What?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:41:22" end="00:49:42:04" region="bottom">I think it's called enabling?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:42:04" end="00:49:43:23" region="bottom">Enabling, yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:43:23" end="00:49:46:09" region="bottom">And it's, it can be dangerous when you have other friends with similar</p>
      <p begin="00:49:46:09" end="00:49:49:06" region="bottom">mental health because you guys can feed off each other.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:49:06" end="00:49:51:05" region="bottom">That is a thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:51:18" end="00:49:56:12" region="bottom">And if you're ever manic and you're happy, like if I see you happy and you're like, should I buy this?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:56:12" end="00:49:58:11" region="bottom">I'm going to be like, fuck yeah, you should.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:58:12" end="00:50:00:11" region="bottom">It's going to make you happy.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:00:11" end="00:50:01:15" region="bottom">I don't know your manic.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:01:22" end="00:50:03:21" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:03:21" end="00:50:04:14" region="bottom">I don't even know.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:04:17" end="00:50:06:16" region="bottom">And that's the thing, too.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:06:16" end="00:50:08:20" region="bottom">Sometimes you don't know your manic.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:08:20" end="00:50:12:14" region="bottom">Do you have anything that you know that</p>
      <p begin="00:50:12:15" end="00:50:14:17" region="bottom">helps you be like, oh, fuck, a manic?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:16:11" end="00:50:19:04" region="bottom">How do you know you were manic for a week or two?</p>
      <p begin="00:50:19:11" end="00:50:23:22" region="bottom">Once I start looking at big purchases, I really should like a little red flag.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:24:17" end="00:50:28:04" region="bottom">So it's checking the bank statement, you're like, fuck, I was manic.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:28:17" end="00:50:30:16" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:30:16" end="00:50:31:16" region="bottom">So I've started</p>
      <p begin="00:50:32:05" end="00:50:35:04" region="bottom">here lately, or at least I'm trying to,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:35:11" end="00:50:38:20" region="bottom">if I am looking into something for more more than</p>
      <p begin="00:50:38:21" end="00:50:41:04" region="bottom">like a month or two,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:42:22" end="00:50:46:09" region="bottom">if I'm not doing that, it's probably a manic episode.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:46:09" end="00:50:49:10" region="bottom">But if I've thought it out and I have all this idea, this</p>
      <p begin="00:50:49:10" end="00:50:52:19" region="bottom">idea, and I've been really excited about it for</p>
      <p begin="00:50:52:20" end="00:50:58:11" region="bottom">a couple months, it's likely, likely not a manic episode.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:58:12" end="00:51:00:11" region="bottom">But when I see</p>
      <p begin="00:51:00:11" end="00:51:03:03" region="bottom">when I see like a box truck for $2,000 and</p>
      <p begin="00:51:03:17" end="00:51:07:01" region="bottom">I'm like, I have to buy this and it's in Cleveland and I buy it</p>
      <p begin="00:51:07:01" end="00:51:10:00" region="bottom">and don't know how I'm going to get it home.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:10:01" end="00:51:13:06" region="bottom">And don't buy it't know if I's</p>
      <p begin="00:51:13:07" end="00:51:17:08" region="bottom">hot and then see the, you know, covered in rust</p>
      <p begin="00:51:17:16" end="00:51:19:15" region="bottom">in an engine that knocks.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:19:22" end="00:51:21:21" region="bottom">Hey, I got it.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:21:21" end="00:51:26:09" region="bottom">It's still, it's sitting in London in a field because it's not worth repairing.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:29:15" end="00:51:32:12" region="bottom">Can you recover any money from it?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:32:13" end="00:51:34:12" region="bottom">Like sell it for parts or something?</p>
      <p begin="00:51:34:12" end="00:51:37:17" region="bottom">With that one, I'm going to use</p>
      <p begin="00:51:38:21" end="00:51:42:18" region="bottom">basically all the mechanical parts.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:42:19" end="00:51:47:06" region="bottom">So like the gas tank with the fuel pump, the Oh, for your RV in case something goes.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:47:07" end="00:51:50:14" region="bottom">I'm going to use all I' to use as much of that as</p>
      <p begin="00:51:50:14" end="00:51:54:11" region="bottom">I can to do my engine swap because I'm going to need a radiator.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:54:11" end="00:51:56:21" region="bottom">I'm going to like a new radiator.m going to need</p>
      <p begin="00:51:57:15" end="00:52:00:02" region="bottom">a transmission, and the one in there is the one I want.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:00:14" end="00:52:02:13" region="bottom">And it's rebuilt.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:02:13" end="00:52:04:12" region="bottom">That's like the nicest thing in it.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:04:15" end="00:52:06:14" region="bottom">It's it rebuilt.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:06:14" end="00:52:09:02" region="bottom">Yeah, it's got like 3,500 miles on a rebuilt.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:09:14" end="00:52:11:13" region="bottom">Oh, whoa.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:11:13" end="00:52:12:19" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:12:19" end="00:52:15:14" region="bottom">And I'm going to grab the gas tank and I might use the rear axle</p>
      <p begin="00:52:15:22" end="00:52:18:01" region="bottom">because it has disc brakes in the rear.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:18:02" end="00:52:22:08" region="bottom">Are you going to be keeping any parts on hand in your RV when you're travelinging?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:22:08" end="00:52:27:10" region="bottom">Like any common things that might go out, like a hoses, belt, something like that, that's easy to stow.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:27:10" end="00:52:30:12" region="bottom">One of the reasons why I</p>
      <p begin="00:52:30:13" end="00:52:35:02" region="bottom">am moving to a newer engine is and it's a very popular engine</p>
      <p begin="00:52:36:07" end="00:52:41:01" region="bottom">is that I can go to any, any parts place and get get parts for it.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:41:10" end="00:52:44:11" region="bottom">Oh, that's another thing to</p>
      <p begin="00:52:44:11" end="00:52:48:19" region="bottom">think of. is how old the vehicle is will you be able to find parts on your route?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:49:07" end="00:52:51:06" region="bottom">That's too bra.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:51:06" end="00:52:52:12" region="bottom">And that, and that engine</p>
      <p begin="00:52:52:12" end="00:52:55:06" region="bottom">is like the most popular</p>
      <p begin="00:52:55:07" end="00:53:01:06" region="bottom">engine for hot rotting and vehicles, truck engines.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:01:07" end="00:53:03:23" region="bottom">It's just a very, very popular family.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:04:00" end="00:53:05:23" region="bottom">So</p>
      <p begin="00:53:05:23" end="00:53:08:11" region="bottom">every, every like</p>
      <p begin="00:53:08:12" end="00:53:11:07" region="bottom">parts store has the stuff I would need.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:11:19" end="00:53:14:12" region="bottom">If not, then they can order it for like the next day.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:14:19" end="00:53:16:18" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:16:18" end="00:53:19:14" region="bottom">Also, if you need to use tools, that's another good thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:19:14" end="00:53:21:13" region="bottom">If you're RV, you can pull over there.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:21:13" end="00:53:23:08" region="bottom">If you don't have like all your tools and you need</p>
      <p begin="00:53:23:11" end="00:53:26:20" region="bottom">a breaker bar to get, you know, a nut</p>
      <p begin="00:53:26:21" end="00:53:30:12" region="bottom">off something, ha ha, you can do that.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:30:13" end="00:53:32:18" region="bottom">All right.Reilly, they won'tan them to you.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:32:18" end="00:53:34:17" region="bottom">Yeah, yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:34:17" end="00:53:35:23" region="bottom">Okay.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:35:23" end="00:53:36:15" region="bottom">So back to</p>
      <p begin="00:53:36:18" end="00:53:39:06" region="bottom">back to living our lives around our mental health.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:39:07" end="00:53:41:06" region="bottom">Aside.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:41:06" end="00:53:44:23" region="bottom">I'm trying to hold it back.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:45:18" end="00:53:47:17" region="bottom">Aide</p>
      <p begin="00:53:47:17" end="00:53:49:14" region="bottom">from</p>
      <p begin="00:53:51:05" end="00:53:53:04" region="bottom">RVing.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:53:04" end="00:53:55:16" region="bottom">What, if any, other changes are you making</p>
      <p begin="00:53:55:16" end="00:53:58:17" region="bottom">to better live with your mental health?</p>
      <p begin="00:53:59:00" end="00:54:02:05" region="bottom">Well, I mean, just to move into a part-time job.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:02:18" end="00:54:06:01" region="bottom">Well, I mean, two huge things. nomadically, lifestyle</p>
      <p begin="00:54:06:01" end="00:54:08:20" region="bottom">and an RV and then, you know, job change.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:08:20" end="00:54:10:19" region="bottom">Those are big things</p>
      <p begin="00:54:10:19" end="00:54:13:16" region="bottom">Yeah, those are the two major things that I did,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:14:05" end="00:54:20:21" region="bottom">you know, giving up on the career, realizing that, you know, what</p>
      <p begin="00:54:21:21" end="00:54:25:05" region="bottom">I don't, you kind of redefine success.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:25:17" end="00:54:27:16" region="bottom">Yes.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:27:16" end="00:54:28:09" region="bottom">But.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:28:09" end="00:54:31:20" region="bottom">You're not getting, well, well,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:31:21" end="00:54:35:11" region="bottom">like most people with me, I don't I don't, I wouldn't say giving up.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:35:11" end="00:54:37:10" region="bottom">You just realized not.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:37:10" end="00:54:39:05" region="bottom">Well, you change it.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:39:05" end="00:54:39:23" region="bottom">You change your definition.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:39:23" end="00:54:41:03" region="bottom">So like</p>
      <p begin="00:54:41:03" end="00:54:43:04" region="bottom">most people will think, you know, making, getting</p>
      <p begin="00:54:43:05" end="00:54:48:16" region="bottom">into their dream job and being successful and like financial success.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:49:03" end="00:54:51:02" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:51:02" end="00:54:53:03" region="bottom">Climbing, climbing the ladder, so to speak.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:53:04" end="00:54:55:03" region="bottom">That's where I wanted to go.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:55:03" end="00:54:59:17" region="bottom">That's just not meant for everybody, but we're all told that from the beginning</p>
      <p begin="00:55:00:02" end="00:55:02:01" region="bottom">Yep.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:02:04" end="00:55:05:08" region="bottom">But, you know, some of us realize that's</p>
      <p begin="00:55:05:09" end="00:55:07:15" region="bottom">it's just not the thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:07:16" end="00:55:09:15" region="bottom">It's not it.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:09:15" end="00:55:10:23" region="bottom">No, capitalism can fuck itself.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:12:14" end="00:55:14:13" region="bottom">I...</p>
      <p begin="00:55:14:13" end="00:55:16:05" region="bottom">What?</p>
      <p begin="00:55:16:05" end="00:55:16:21" region="bottom">Eat the rich.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:16:21" end="00:55:17:21" region="bottom">Eat the rich.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:17:21" end="00:55:19:09" region="bottom">Feed the rich to the hungry.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:19:10" end="00:55:21:09" region="bottom">Fuck you.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:21:09" end="00:55:22:06" region="bottom">Feed the rich to the hungry and the poor.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:22:06" end="00:55:24:20" region="bottom">No, I'm not promoting cannibalism.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:24:21" end="00:55:26:20" region="bottom">A little bit.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:26:20" end="00:55:28:13" region="bottom">No, no, I'm really not.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:28:22" end="00:55:32:02" region="bottom">God, if</p>
      <p begin="00:55:32:03" end="00:55:37:03" region="bottom">I got into politics right now, we would, this episode would be so long.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:37:09" end="00:55:39:08" region="bottom">That's what he said.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:39:21" end="00:55:43:02" region="bottom">How else can you change your life for your mental health?</p>
      <p begin="00:55:44:03" end="00:55:48:16" region="bottom">I mean, I mean, change the place you live.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:48:17" end="00:55:50:16" region="bottom">I</p>
      <p begin="00:55:52:03" end="00:55:54:02" region="bottom">But I don't know.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:54:02" end="00:55:57:16" region="bottom">I think one thing I would that would</p>
      <p begin="00:55:57:17" end="00:56:00:11" region="bottom">help because it's going to be different for everybody.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:01:10" end="00:56:04:18" region="bottom">But like picture yourself</p>
      <p begin="00:56:04:19" end="00:56:09:15" region="bottom">in five years if money wasn't wasn't the issue.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:09:15" end="00:56:11:23" region="bottom">There was no issue without what would you be doing?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:13:15" end="00:56:15:14" region="bottom">Or in five years.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:15:14" end="00:56:18:19" region="bottom">What would you be doing if you weren't worried about making money,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:19:10" end="00:56:25:02" region="bottom">weren't worried about climbing the ladder, weren't worried about buying a big house.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:26:20" end="00:56:30:13" region="bottom">And, you know, if you're like us,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:32:02" end="00:56:34:19" region="bottom">pursue that, set that as your goal.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:36:08" end="00:56:38:19" region="bottom">If you're like us, meaning mental health?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:39:14" end="00:56:43:07" region="bottom">Meaning that we just don't fit into the cutter.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:43:08" end="00:56:45:13" region="bottom">The mold that.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:45:13" end="00:56:47:12" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:47:12" end="00:56:49:10" region="bottom">My pictures of the van build and</p>
      <p begin="00:56:49:10" end="00:56:52:07" region="bottom">then pictures of the RV build.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:52:07" end="00:56:54:06" region="bottom">Talk about that.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:54:06" end="00:56:55:04" region="bottom">You have two vehicles, actually.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:55:04" end="00:56:57:01" region="bottom">So what is your plan for that?</p>
      <p begin="00:56:57:13" end="00:57:01:06" region="bottom">The van is going to be more</p>
      <p begin="00:57:01:07" end="00:57:04:11" region="bottom">of a exploration vehicle.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:04:11" end="00:57:06:10" region="bottom">It's smaller.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:06:10" end="00:57:07:02" region="bottom">It can fit on trails, better.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:07:02" end="00:57:09:05" region="bottom">Oh, like the away shuttle from the Enterprise.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:09:05" end="00:57:11:13" region="bottom">Yeah. park and then go sightsee.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:12:18" end="00:57:16:01" region="bottom">But it's not going to go out on every trip with the RV.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:16:01" end="00:57:18:18" region="bottom">It's just going to be like the Weekender kind of thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:19:07" end="00:57:22:08" region="bottom">And then we also have disced making making</p>
      <p begin="00:57:22:08" end="00:57:25:17" region="bottom">a guest room when we're on the road.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:25:18" end="00:57:27:17" region="bottom">Right.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:27:17" end="00:57:30:13" region="bottom">I was just going to say, if someone wanted to come join you, yeah, go run by my house.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:30:20" end="00:57:32:19" region="bottom">My brother's there.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:32:19" end="00:57:33:20" region="bottom">Here's the keys.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:33:20" end="00:57:35:20" region="bottom">And then they get in the vehicle and they drive to you.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:35:21" end="00:57:37:20" region="bottom">Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:37:20" end="00:57:39:06" region="bottom">How cool is that?</p>
      <p begin="00:57:39:06" end="00:57:43:03" region="bottom">And then they can just drive back, park it, and, hey, we just visited Brandon.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:43:03" end="00:57:45:02" region="bottom">Oh, where'd you go?</p>
      <p begin="00:57:45:06" end="00:57:47:05" region="bottom">Washington State.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:47:05" end="00:57:50:07" region="bottom">That's where they're based right now.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:50:08" end="00:57:52:07" region="bottom">Why?</p>
      <p begin="00:57:52:07" end="00:57:53:23" region="bottom">Middle of the desert, you know, stuff like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:54:12" end="00:57:57:02" region="bottom">Oh, I mean if it's too hot, I probably won't visit.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:57:02" end="00:57:59:04" region="bottom">It gets cold at night from what I gather.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:59:05" end="00:58:01:04" region="bottom">Then I guess I'll be visiting you at night.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:01:12" end="00:58:04:22" region="bottom">This body doesn't do heat very well.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:04:23" end="00:58:06:22" region="bottom">Doesn't like it.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:06:22" end="00:58:08:06" region="bottom">Oh, I don't.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:08:06" end="00:58:11:17" region="bottom">But I also hate winters, so my water is so gross.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:13:12" end="00:58:15:11" region="bottom">Water?</p>
      <p begin="00:58:15:11" end="00:58:16:09" region="bottom">Yeah, it's so gross.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:16:09" end="00:58:17:23" region="bottom">It's like.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:18:12" end="00:58:21:18" region="bottom">And I'm not even talking about tap water, like city water.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:21:18" end="00:58:25:11" region="bottom">I'm not even talking about that peatry dish of piss.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:25:11" end="00:58:27:20" region="bottom">I'm talking about just water in general</p>
      <p begin="00:58:28:09" end="00:58:31:04" region="bottom">is gross and boring.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:31:17" end="00:58:33:16" region="bottom">I mean, I know we need it.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:33:16" end="00:58:35:01" region="bottom">Our bodies were like 5,000% water.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:35:01" end="00:58:36:23" region="bottom">I get it.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:36:23" end="00:58:37:16" region="bottom">That one's for you, Sarah.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:37:16" end="00:58:39:00" region="bottom">I get it.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:39:00" end="00:58:40:00" region="bottom">I get it.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:40:00" end="00:58:40:13" region="bottom">We're a lot of water, but</p>
      <p begin="00:58:41:11" end="00:58:43:10" region="bottom">can it have a flavor?</p>
      <p begin="00:58:43:10" end="00:58:45:10" region="bottom">Like I mean, you can flavor.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:46:05" end="00:58:48:21" region="bottom">Could it not come naturally that way?</p>
      <p begin="00:58:48:21" end="00:58:52:10" region="bottom">Like I think even if it had a flavor,</p>
      <p begin="00:58:53:17" end="00:58:55:16" region="bottom">we wouldn't be able to taste it.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:56:11" end="00:58:58:10" region="bottom">Why?</p>
      <p begin="00:58:58:10" end="00:58:59:10" region="bottom">Well, I don't have it.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:59:10" end="00:59:00:07" region="bottom">We're 75% water.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:00:08" end="00:59:02:07" region="bottom">We drink it all the time.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:04:04" end="00:59:07:12" region="bottom">I guess. that's fair., you</p>
      <p begin="00:59:07:13" end="00:59:11:13" region="bottom">Well, when I'm in the cave sometimes, I like to I like</p>
      <p begin="00:59:11:13" end="00:59:14:10" region="bottom">to drink some of some of the mineral water that flows to it.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:14:10" end="00:59:16:22" region="bottom">I've licked the walls before in a cave.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:16:23" end="00:59:20:03" region="bottom">I've licked the rock wall before just to see what it's tasted like,</p>
      <p begin="00:59:20:03" end="00:59:22:21" region="bottom">you know, and that's how pandemics start, right?</p>
      <p begin="00:59:22:21" end="00:59:27:08" region="bottom">That's how someone randomly get some virus or bacteria that they didn't even know existed</p>
      <p begin="00:59:27:20" end="00:59:30:15" region="bottom">because they wanted to lick a fucking wall in a cave.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:30:22" end="00:59:32:21" region="bottom">Was you all alone?</p>
      <p begin="00:59:32:21" end="00:59:34:06" region="bottom">Yeah, it was me.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:34:06" end="00:59:35:16" region="bottom">It was me.</p>
      <p begin="00:59:35:16" end="00:59:36:08" region="bottom">I went to Carter caves and I licked it.</p>
