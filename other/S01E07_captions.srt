1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,211
Hey, humans, thanks for joining my podcast.

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:09,050
This podcast is a place to share unedited lived experiences regarding mental health.

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,178
We'll touch on how it shows up in our lives and provide

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,474
some tips that have worked for me and others on how to manage it.

5
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,898
There will be strong language, and definitely the

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,943
potential for disturbing and or triggering content.

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:30,280
Please be aware of this and mindful of

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,407
others who may be in earshot.

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,036
Most importantly, and as horribly fucking

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,206
cliche as this sounds, you really do not have to go through this alone.

11
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,961
And hopefully you'll see this and feel this more and more as you listen.

12
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:49,132
And hey, if this podcast isn't for you, that's fine.

13
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,134
There are lots of them out there.

14
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,471
Find one that speaks to you and helps you.

15
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,432
So, let's talk mental health.

16
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,460
And now the boiler plate and cover your ass claws

17
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:31,090
On this podcast, unless explicitly stated,

18
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,511
no one on this show is a medical professional in

19
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,889
any way, and as such, no content on

20
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:41,893
this show is intended to be, whether implied or otherwise,

21
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,145
to be taken as medical advice.

22
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,858
If you are in crisis, please call 988

23
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:53,696
or 911 or go to your nearest emergency room.

24

00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,429
Today

39
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,474
I want to discuss a little bit on repetition and reactivity.

40
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,687
I'm sure you are familiar with the saying

41
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:12,609
insanity is doing the same thing over and over again

42
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,278
but expecting different results.

43
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,823
And this quote is often misattributed

44
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:22,660
to Einstein, there is zero evidence

45
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,205
that he has said this.

46
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,875
To point out, it is definitely not the quinical definition of

47
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,211
insanity in any way.

48
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,923
And whomever said this was not getting an accurate

49
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:40,470
observation to create said, quote, it's more of a legal

50
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,182
term than a clinical term.

51
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:49,938
So think of light bulbs, right?

52
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,317
We had that ass hat who likes

53
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:59,989
to steal other people's work and claim it as his own, Thomas Edison, making the light bulb.

54
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,452
And he is famous, we quoted, saying, " I have not failed 10,000 times.

55
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:08,456
I have successfully found 10,000 ways that will not work."

56
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,752
Smartphones are any technology, really

57
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,171
started back in the day.

58
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,340
We had car phones that were bricks.

59
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,134
They were very heavy, they were very huge.

60
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:23,179
We had backpacks that had the batteries in them,

61
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,515
we had giant car phones and our cars

62
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,352
And now they're so small, they can fit in the palm

63
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,897
of your hand, be concealed in your pocket, a purse,

64
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,483
a bag, and even your bra.

65
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,694
I've seen that many times.

66
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,446
How about aviation?

67
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,407
There's a lot of repetitiveness as well.

68
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,493
Coffee brewing methods, you know, people who

69
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:50,415
have their own coffee beans grow them, or

70
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:54,293
don't grow them, people who just make coffee at home, we

71
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:59,507
repeatedly try different methods until we get the flavor and, you know,

72
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,051
taste the way we want.

73
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,429
Musical expertise.

74
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,223
Hello.

75
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,475
I've been studying and playing for 40 plus

76
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:13,104
years and I don't know everything there is to know about music

77
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:17,650
theory or piano or any of the other instruments I used to play

78
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,194
And no one ever will.

79
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,364
But we still repeat what we do over and over

80
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,700
and practice until we get it.

81
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,202
We're not insane.

82
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,164
Baby humans learning to walk.

83
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,124
They get up and they fall.

84
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,001
They get up, and they fall.

85
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:39,213
They get up, they fall, they scream, wash, rinse, repeat.

86
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,426
Those of us who are able, eventually, we learn to walk.

87
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,928
All by repetition

88
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,309
So I have these 12 sentences

89
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,729
that people use when they're under pressure.

90
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,608
A lot of these I learned in therapy, and some of them I found

91
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,944
online.

92
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,946
So real briefly.

93
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,699
Number one, I need a minute to think this through.

94
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,204
Number two, help me understand your perspective.

95
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,415
Number three, that's interesting.

96
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,417
Can you tell me more?

97
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,629
Number four, I notice I'm feeling reactive

98
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,215
right now. and we're going to come back to that one.

99
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,676
Number five, let's pause and come back to this.

100
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:30,932
Number six, what would a good outcome look like for you?

101
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,686
Number seven, I appreciate you bringing this to my attention.

102
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:41,192
Number eight, I see this differently, but I'm curious about your view.

103
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,696
Number nine, can we explore other options together?

104
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,699
Number 10.

105
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,575
I'm not ready to decide yet.

106
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,203
Number 11.

107
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,079
What am I missing here?

108
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,706
Number 12.

109
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,875
Let me reflect on that and get back to you.

110
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,920
Now, some of these, you might

111
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,966
be thinking, are kind of in the same under the same umbrella, and they are.

112
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:09,303
For instance, I need a minute, let's pause.

113
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,265
I'm not ready.

114
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,225
Let me reflect and get back to you.

115
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,186
So some of these are under the same umbrella, yes.

116
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,858
But the one I want to talk about the most right now is the number four.

117
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,486
I notice I'm feeling reactive right now.

118
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,197
Okay, what's that mean?

119
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,951
Yes, you're right.

120
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,910
That's exactly what it means.

121
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,036
So.

122
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,456
I am feeling reactive right now.

123
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,669
The most fascinating thing happens in our brains,

124
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:46,048
neurologically, when we become reactive.

125
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:49,385
Often it's called an amygdala

126
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,721
hijack or emotional flooding.

127
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:56,767
This is what happens in our brains during these reactive moments.

128
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,855
Our amygdala, that's the part of your brain that handles

129
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,149
threat detection.

130
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,526
That's our threat detection system.

131
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,528
And it essentially takes over.

132
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,448
Then give it like a home security alarm

133
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,243
at your house or apartment or whatever.

134
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,204
More on that in a minute.

135
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,497
When it perceives a threat, when our amygdala perceives a

136
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,418
threat, whether it's physical or emotional, it

137
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,463
will bypass your prefrontal cortex.

138
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:30,593
I'm sorry, it can bypass your prefrontal cortex.

139
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,721
And your prefrontal cortex is

140
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:38,726
the part of your brain that's responsible for rational thinking and decision making

141
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,979
and impulse control.

142
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,066
So we become reactive.

143
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,068
What happens?

144
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,528
Well, as we've discussed many times before,

145
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:54,492
we have the stress hormone cortisol, and then we have adrenaline flooding our system

146
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,788
Blood flow actually will decrease to

147
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,625
your prefontal cortex, and your body emotionally

148
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:07,880
and depending on the situation, emotionally and physically, into flight

149
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,967
fight, or freeze mode.

150
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,179
I know you've heard of fight or flight, but there's also freeze.

151
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,975
Some people, they freeze, like a deer in the headlights.

152
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,604
So once we are in this armed state,

153
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:29,360
our ability to process complex information becomes immensely limited

154
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,196
So back to the home security system.

155
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,200
You come home, you open the door, and

156
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,370
you hear a beeping to notify you that you have about 10 or

157
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,164
five or 15 seconds to enter your pin number

158
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,834
and disable the alarm.

159
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,254
Or for you fancy pants people out there, you open an app

160
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,757
on your phone, tap on something, to disarm it, or tell

161
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,136
your quote unquote smart device to disable it, whatever.

162
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,138
Then

163
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,057
some people, when they get home and in

164
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:04,895
their homes, they rearm their systems, but only certain zones.

165
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:10,192
An example would be like the perimeter of their abode, the doors and the windows.

166
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,488
So us, our amygdala,

167
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:18,367
our threat detection system, we have the same thing.

168
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,370
We have our baseline vigilance, which is

169
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:25,333
our perimeter zone is armed, and that's our basicual

170
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,960
situational awareness.

171
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:31,589
Then we have that initial alert, which is, you know, first motion

172
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:36,469
detected, and it can be, you know, your gut feeling that, oh, shit, something's off.

173
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,973
There's a verification period, a delay, and

174
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:45,686
that's where you consciously, your prefontal cortex, is assessing the situation situation.

175
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:52,026
Then, well, fuck, threat confirmed, DCon 1, sound the alarm

176
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,863
Senor amygdala has now taken controls.

177
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,948
It is his airplane now.

178
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:04,580
So using that analogy, think of what's something I don't do, but probably should.

179
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,541
Think about going out, going to a party, visiting friends,

180
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,920
going out to eat, something social, something that takes you out

181
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,173
of your comfortable safe space.

182
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,176
So what do we do?

183
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,470
We arm our body and minds security system.

184
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,430
All of it.

185
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,975
Motion sensors, our eyes, windows and doors, the perimeter, physical, our physical selves

186
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,354
our personal bubble, our space.

187
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,773
This is our baseline vigilance.

188
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,192
Basic situational awareness.

189
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:38,948
Somehow, we end up finding ourselves in a situation that's

190
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,701
we'll say not quite ideal.

191
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,206
And we have picked up with our motion sensors, our eyes,

192
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,458
that something alerted us.

193
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,254
That's our initial alert.

194
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,339
First motion detected.

195
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,925
And it can be your gut telling you something's off.

196
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,469
But it's not imminent.

197
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,597
And just like, you know, your home alarm system,

198
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,476
motion sensors can be set to not immediately sound the alarm

199
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,688
when motion is detected.

200
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,690
And this feature is great.

201
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,985
It was designed for people with animals or

202
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:21,949
robot vacuums running around their homes cleaning or babies, children running around the house, etc.

203
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,952
So we have this alert.

204
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:30,040
We enter our proverbial pin, and we disable the alarm.

205
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,001
So what's our proverbial pin?

206
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,672
Menacting mindfulness and other techniques more on that later.

207
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:44,430
So, disabled, we're good, rearmed, going around.

208
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,433
Shit.

209
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,392
Find ourselves in another situation.

210
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,730
A potential thing up ahead that we're aware of.

211
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,818
So we have our initial alert, again, and

212
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:01,322
we see that thing is escalating, and we see that the

213
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,783
situation is starting to go south quickly

214
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:08,162
zero questions or doubt. verification

215
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:13,209
has happened, and we are now have a full-on detection confirmed,

216
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,962
and it's not a dog or evacuum or a baby are running around the house.

217
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,924
This is a full alarm, and the control panel

218
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,177
is screaming that Senor amygdala is about

219
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,597
to take over with zero conscious inputput

220
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,891
from you.

221
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,227
So, it's screaming.

222
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:36,440
We've entered fight or flight freeze mode, quarisol and adrenaline squirting out through our bodies.

223
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,735
Blood flow decreases from your prefontal

224
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:44,615
cortex, as I said before, which is where your decisions impulse to all that is handled

225
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:49,286
And complex information

226
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,288
is especially difficult

227
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,459
to handle when you're reactive.

228
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,338
It becomes severely limited, and extreme

229
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,216
cases completely non nonexistent.

230
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,677
Can it be a false alarm?

231
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:09,431
Of course, just like physical alarm systems and tests can have false positives

232
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:16,230
our system can be hypervigilant, over sensitive?

233
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:21,193
Seemingly broken, huh, miscalibrated?

234
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,696
But why?

235
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,658
Why is our defense system perceived as

236
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,578
broken or miscalibrated by us?

237
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,956
Well, things in our

238
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,209
lives, our past, past trauma, stresses

239
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:43,632
lack of maintenance, which is not practicing emotional regulation techniques.

240
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:48,679
Think of it like your pin number to disarm the alarm.

241
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,806
If you don't use it often

242
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,560
or you forget it, or your inner

243
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,690
situation under massive amounts of stress, you cannot disable the alarm.

244
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:05,195
Without practice, without memorizing what to do, you can't disable the alarm.

245
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,825
Both systems, you know, the real alarm at wherever

246
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:14,121
you are, and your on personal

247
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:18,042
alarm, your brain, your amygdala, can be recalibrated

248
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,837
with maintenance and adjustments, just like a physical alarm.

249
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:29,219
We upgrade the firmware in our brains with sensitivity adjustments.

250
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,221
And what is that?

251
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,474
Well, professional therapy, practicing

252
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,185
mindfulness, practicing mindfulness.

253
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,187
And

254
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,106
both fortunately and unfortunately, experience.

255
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,360
You you got to do these things and get practice doing

256
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,698
this and being in the situation to help you do it.

257
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,659
It's not fun.

258
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,494
I'm not going to lie.

259
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,828
There are times when it is really not fun

260
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,331
but but you have to do it.

261
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,210
Now, what's really interesting in this,

262
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:05,547
when your amygdo takes over, it happens in milliseconds,

263
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:09,426
and that's way faster than our consciousness little brains can process it.

264
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,179
By the time you're aware, you're angry

265
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,517
that physiological response

266
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,603
in your body is long already underway.

267
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,563
That ship has sailed.

268
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,691
This is why

269
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,404
developing awareness of your

270
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:32,241
triggers and and practicing emotional regulation techniques

271
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,119
are required.

272
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,288
They help you recognize and manage these

273
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,291
responses before they take full control

274
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,922
I notice I'm feeling reactive right now.

275
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:51,135
How many of you know what that means?

276
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,137
Like, how many of you

277
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,348
know what it is to feel that you're being

278
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:01,520
reactive versus calmly, consciously

279
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,772
trying to make a decision and assess?

280
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,442
How do we know if we're feeling reactive?

281
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,944
Unfortunately, sometimes

282
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:14,241
if you don't have the skills yet, it's far too late.

283
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,286
And after whatever has happened happened, that we

284
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,622
realize, fuck, I was reactive.

285
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,583
I should not have done that.

286
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,126
Why did I do that?

287
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,502
Why am I like this?

288
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:30,424
Don't let yourself fall into a spiral like that.

289
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,844
It's not, why am I like this or why are you like this?

290
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,846
Why are you broken?

291
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,847
Why am I broken?

292
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,890
It's not.

293
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,599
We're not broken.

294
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:44,438
We just have to learn and practice more skills.

295
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,690
That's it.

296
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,192
I know it sounds.

297
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,153
Well, it sounds easy and it sounds hard.

298
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,822
And it is.

299
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,324
It's both.

300
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,241
It is easy and it's hard.

301
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,952
I don't know how to explain that, but

302
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,457
it is.

303
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,458
Trust the process.

304
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,667
It is.

305
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,168
It's easy and it's hard.

306
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,214
So I want you throughout this week.

307
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,176
Kind of. be mindful.

308
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:18,138
And throughout your

309
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,600
day, this week, see if you can find a

310
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,812
time where something has made you feel reactive.

311
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:28,732
Now, you don't have to to go, you know, all DEFCON 1 and to

312
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,777
later realize, oh, I was reactive.

313
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,737
That's not what I mean.

314
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,325
I want to know if you can feel

315
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:42,621
that you are reactive, but before you

316
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,999
actually react and do something, before

317
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,710
your amygdala has been taken over.

318
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,171
Try and see what that feels like.

319
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,048
See if you can determine

320
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,051
when you feel reactive.

321
00:18:56,093 --> 00:19:00,472
And then backtrack and find out why.

322
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,935
What made you feel reactive?

323
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,771
Did someone say something?

324
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,398
Did someone do something?

325
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,692
Did it affect you directly?

326
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,152
Did it affect you in indirectly?

327
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,904
The only way we're going

328
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,866
to get better at not being reactive

329
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:23,453
is identifying when we're feeling reactive.

330
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,582
And the only way we can do that,

331
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:30,502
aside from someone telling us, but it's too weight by them, is

332
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,672
to practice all of these mental health techniques.

333
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,427
Thank you, everybody.

334
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,678
I hope you have a great day.

335
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,138
You are not alone.

336
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,431
You are not a burden.

337
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,683
You are you.

338
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,729
Let's try to be happy and love who we are.

339
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,940
Okay, that's all the time we have today.

340
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,985
Thank you, everyone who joined and listened.

341
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,572
I truly hope you were able to take something from this that

342
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,866
will help you better manage your mental health.

343
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:06,079
Please also keep in your mind that this takes work and time.

344
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:11,168
There is no quick fix, so please allow yourself some grace and compassion.

345
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,171
I hope you join again next time as we continue

346
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:18,508
dismantling the ridiculous stigma that surrounds mental health.

347
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,469
And until next time

348
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,471
don't throat punch anyone.

349
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,932
Bye-bye.
