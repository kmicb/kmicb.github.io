1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,211
Hey, humans, thanks for joining my podcast.

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:09,050
This podcast is a place to share unedited lived experiences regarding mental health.

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,178
We'll touch on how it shows up in our lives and provide

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,474
some tips that have worked for me and others on how to manage it.

5
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,898
There will be strong language and definitely the

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,943
potential for disturbing and or triggering content.

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:30,280
Please be aware of this and mindful of

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,449
others who may be in earshot.

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,036
Most importantly, and as horribly fucking

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,206
cliche as this sounds, you really do not have to go through this alone.

11
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,961
And hopefully you'll see this and feel this more and more as you listen.

12
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:48,923
And hey, if this podcast isn't for you, that's fine.

13
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,176
There are lots of them out there.

14
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,471
Find one that speaks to you and helps you.

15
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,432
So, let's talk mental health.

16
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,460
And now the boiler plate and cover your ass claws

17
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:31,090

18
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,511

19
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,889
any way, and as such, no content on

20
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:41,893
this show is intended to be, whether implied or otherwise,

21
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,062

00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,220
Hello, everyone.

39
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,138
Thanks for joining me.

40
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,642
We didn't have an episode last week, so I wanted to talk

41
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,479
about that on this week's episode titled

42
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,940
A Pja Torres and Fermatas.

43
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,943
When holding onFs with Your Harmony.

44
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,198
Real quick, an Apatra is a musical

45
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,993
theory term. used to describe

46
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,622
a grace note ornamental, something

47
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:29,834
that's not typically part of the measure,

48
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,212
so to speak, can create tension resolution

49
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,425
It's not constrained to the timing of that measure.

50
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:41,638
And a firmata, also known as bird's

51
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:46,935
eyes, or the bird eye, means to hold that note or to hold that rest

52
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,687
for as long as you want.

53
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,690
So

54
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,944
Last week, I did not produce an episode.

55
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,446
A lot was going on.

56
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,949
There was still a lot going on.

57
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,743
And it kind of consumed me.

58
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:10,124
And I wanted to talk about the paradox of productivity.

59
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:13,169
And it's not lost on me the irony of not doing a mental

60
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,214
health podcast episode due to mental health.

61
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,216
That's not lost on me.

62
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,678
I want to talk about how taking breaks and

63
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,182
stepping back is actually a form of productivity.

64
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:30,478
A lot of people view rest

65
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,856
as laziness, like, we're lazy, we don't want

66
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,109
to do anything, but it's critical

67
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,029
for sustainable performance, right?

68
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,283
To be able to keep doing what I do or to keep doing what

69
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,995
you do, you have to be in the right mindset to do so.

70
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,331
And what happened with me is a perfect example.

71
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,291
I had to take time that I needed

72
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,670
to ensure I was at my best.

73
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,633
If I'm not at my best or damn

74
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,844
close to it, I can't give you my best.

75
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,804
I can't give anybody my best.

76
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,641
And I have to ensure my long term authenticity

77
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,395
of who I am, what I believe in,, this podcast's

78
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,939
core values, my core, which are my core values.

79
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,861
And this challenges that toxic

80
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:25,116
productivity narrives that society

81
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,828
pushes people to constantly produce

82
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,039
at the expense of our wellbeing.

83
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,916
True commitment is not about never missing a be

84
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,838
but more maintaining the integrity with

85
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,008
yourself and your audience, which is you all.

86
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,011
I'm being as transparent as I can about

87
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:50,725
mine, medical health or mental health and and my mental health needs, which I'm hoping is showing

88
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,312
well, I'm being vulnerable, which isn't something I like to do.

89
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:58,066
But it shows my vulnerability and

90
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,694
I guess authenticity.

91
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:11,704
I want to break down the myth that professionals, people who work

92
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:18,711
must always appear superhuman and invulnerable.

93
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:24,717
So I want to talk about today mental health

94
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:30,431
and when you need to take a break, and it's okay to take a break.

95
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:35,812
Taking breaks and and stepping back is actually a form of productivity.

96
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,815
A lot of people view rest as waziness, but

97
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,776
it's critical for sustainable performance

98
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,738
This podcast and last week's non-existent episode

99
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:51,160
is a perfect example of this by taking the time that I needed

100
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,623
to ensure my long-term

101
00:06:55,665 --> 00:07:02,463
quality and authenticity of my podcast, my episodes.

102
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:07,718
And this challenges the toxic bullshit productivity narrative

103
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,305
that we've all been bred into us to believe

104
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:17,687
that tells us, I need to constantly produce at the expense of my health.

105
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,439
Grind, grind, grind.

106
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,444
I love you all, but you're not worth my inner harmony.

107
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,990
So we need to redefine commitment

108
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,451
and professionalism.

109
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,830
True commitment isn't about never missing a beat.

110
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:39,208
It's about maintaining your integrity and the integrity

111
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,295
of what you're doing with yourself and your audience, by

112
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,798
being transparent about your mental health needs, your

113
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,342
modeling, vulnerability, and

114
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,761
authenticity.

115
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,890
This approach completely destroys the

116
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,810
myth that professionals must always appear

117
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,438
invulnerable and superhuman.

118
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,858
So let's unpack that real quick.

119
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,818
Today's work culture

120
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,946
demands continuous output,

121
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:13,451
regardless, treating us like machines rather than the complex

122
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:17,371
beings that we are with the emotional and mental needs.

123
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,291
Choosing our needs over arbitrary

124
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,795
production metrics is a form of resistance

125
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,465
and a fuck you to capital.ism.

126
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:32,345
So is there a difference between, you know, self care

127
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,181
and avoidance?

128
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,684
Yes, there is.

129
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,312
And so we have the

130
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:45,441
start tiny, like microscopic tiny.

131
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,695
So is there a difference between strategic self care

132
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,448
and avoidance?

133
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:57,745
Yes, there is a difference between self care and avoidance.

134
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,207
Avoidance is a defense mechanism.

135
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,336
We attempt to escape or ignore the challenging

136
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:09,382
situations, and we suppress emotions or problems

137
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:13,511
instead of addressing them. tempporarily

138
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:18,224
alleviating discomfort without resolving underlying issues,

139
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:23,104
uh, creating short term relief at the potential cost of long term growth

140
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,108
using distractions or withdrawal

141
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,485
as a primary coping strategy.

142
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:35,700
Avoidance is like putting a Band-Aid on a broken leg.

143
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,204
Strategic self-care is getting some crutches,

144
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,458
seeing a doctor, and actually healing.

145
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,379
It's about facing your shit, but not in the brual way.

146
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,841
More like,kay, this sucks, but,

147
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,468
you know, I got I've got this, I can do it."

148
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,929
Instead of, this sucks

149
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,181
I'm gonna hide forever.

150
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,516
I'm gonna retreat.

151
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,601
This always happens.

152
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,186
The bottom always seems to fall out.

153
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,439
The key difference

154
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:11,694
difference is, I should say, lie in the intentionality and the long term impact.

155
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:16,449
Selfcare empowers you and helps you become more resilient.

156
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,411
And avoidance ultimately increases

157
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,456
stress and prevents personal development.

158
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:28,461
Some examples. repeatedly calling

159
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:33,924
in sick to escape work stress without addressing the root cause.

160
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,260
That's avoidance.

161
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,722
Self care, taking a mental health day

162
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,100
to rest, reflect, and recharge.

163
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,062
Refusing to look at bank statements,

164
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:51,192
ignoring bills, spending impulsively to feel better, I've been there.

165
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,279
Strategic selfcare, counteract that, creating a

166
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,908
budget, setting financial goals, learning about personal

167
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:03,371
finances, seeking financial counseling, if able, and

168
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,999
if needed, developing a debt repayment plan.

169
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,001
If that's, you know, a situation situation you're in

170
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,380
Consistently declining invitations,

171
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,426
isolating completely to prevent potential social discomfort, that's avoidance.

172
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,972
Gradually exposing yourself to social situations,

173
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,768
practicing social skills, seeking therapy, if needed,

174
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,813
using anxiety management techniques like deep breathing

175
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,732
that strategic self care..

176
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,945
Ignoring persistent health problems,

177
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:41,701
ignoring our bodies, avoiding medical checkups, simply out of fear.

178
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,953
Yes, mental health, I get it.

179
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,455
but that's still avoidance.

180
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:51,085
Strategic self care is kind of

181
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:55,548
forcing yourself to do regular medical checkups, tuning

182
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:00,803
in and listening to your body when it tells you something, addressing health concerns proactively

183
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,765
developing healthy lifestyle habits, Suppressing

184
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:08,936
emotions, using substances to numb our feelings,

185
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,939
and refusing to acknowledge emotional pain.

186
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,192
Yes, avoidance.

187
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,695
Self-care.

188
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,865
Journaling, talking with

189
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,452
trusted friends, again, seeking therapy if needed,

190
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:30,583
practicing emotional regulation techniques, and we will will get into some of those.

191
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,296
So, just a quick little bullet point here of some

192
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:39,216
indicators of strategic self care, things that are good.

193
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,678
Proactive approach, long term perspective,

194
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,932
personal growth orientation, healthy boundary setting

195
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:52,688
emotional intelligence, and problem solving focus.

196
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:57,193
The opposite, avoidance, is a reactive approach.

197
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,363
It's a short term relief, temporary escape

198
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,367
and it increases anxietyiety over time.

199
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:09,830
You have emotional suppression, and problem

200
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,209
perpetuating behavior.

201
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,212
It's a cycle that we need to

202
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,257
break.

203
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,093
So we need to redefine what commitment

204
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,221
is and what professionalism is.

205
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,182
So true commitment is not about never missing a beat.

206
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,519
We're human.

207
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,228
We can't do that.

208
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,230
It's about maintaining your integrity with yourself and

209
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:39,151
your audience, whoever that may be, whether it be a podcast,

210
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:43,447
audience, radio, audience, TV, audience, or friends, family, whatever.

211
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,368
By being transparent about your mental health needs

212
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,705
you' modeling vulnerability and authenticity.

213
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,960
And that approach completely destroys

214
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,631
the myth that we must always appear invulnerable

215
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,300
and superhuman.

216
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,427
So let's unpack this real quick.

217
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,806
Today's work culture demands, pretty

218
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,684
much all demands, continuous output.

219
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,770
regardless of the expense.

220
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,398
Treating us like machines rather than complex beings with

221
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,692
emotional and mental needs.

222
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,445
Choosing our needs over arbitrary productivity

223
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:28,701
metrics is a form of resistance and a fuck you to capitalism.

224
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:34,206
So if you're feeling overwhelmed, just take three deep breaths.

225
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,960
If you can't face that whole messy room,

226
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,714
just clean one surface, one table, one little nightstand,

227
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,633
show some progress to yourself.

228
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,428
Stressed out about work.

229
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,055
Send that one email that you have been avoiding and get it

230
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,224
off your plate, if you can.

231
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,936
Practice saying no.

232
00:14:55,936 --> 00:15:00,190
I know we've discussed this before because no is a full sentence.

233
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:05,446
So a friend wants to hang out when you're exhausted.

234
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,532
Sorry, can't today.

235
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,452
You get extra work dumped on you at work.

236
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,204
I can't take that on right now.

237
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,457
Family drama invitation.

238
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,959
Not today, Satan.

239
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,422
But not this.

240
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,342
Hey, there's a fire in the kitchen.

241
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,344
Hand me that extinguisher.

242
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,679
No, I don't do red things."

243
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,433
Wayne, but avoidance.

244
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,439
When you can do emotional triage,

245
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,193
you will better understand what's happening in your brain.

246
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:48,697
So think of your mental health like a first aid kit.

247
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,743
If you're feeling low, ask yourself,

248
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:58,207
what's the smallest thing that might help me feel even 1% better?

249
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,252
Could be drinking some water, stepping outside, petting a

250
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:05,214
dog, listening to one good song?

251
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,425
That's all it takes.

252
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,178
And then boundaries.

253
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,182
Boundaries, they're not walls.

254
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,685
They're guardrails.

255
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,354
Work is trying to own your wife, right?

256
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,648
No, set an end of work alarm.

257
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,485
I used to do this, and an office maid of mine used to do this.

258
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,363
We would set our alarms on our phones for about

259
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,575
five to 10 minutes before work was over so

260
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:37,496
that we could start wrapping things up and firing off

261
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:42,710
emails that need to be finished, you know, shutting down some equipment,

262
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,671
things like that.

263
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,133
Instead of waiting to the last minute, when 5 o'clock

264
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:53,345
hits, and then you have to do all this stuff that you're

265
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,931
not being paid to do past five o'clock.

266
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,768
You've got a toxic friend always dumping on you.

267
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,188
Well, you limit the call times, but maybe

268
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,276
also look inwards as to why you still have a toxic friend.

269
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,278
That could be a problem.

270
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,906
Family pushing your buttons, and you have to

271
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,827
go to this event, well, have a preplanned exit strategy.

272
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,955
Have someone call you 15 minutes in as

273
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,293
a kind of test the waters to see how things are and how you're feeling

274
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,672
And if you already know, it's going to be a shit show,

275
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,176
then tell your friend to call you back in whatever time span you need,

276
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,471
five minutes, 30 minutes an hour, and leave.

277
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,682
Nothing wrong with that.

278
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,226
Remember, know always a full sentenceence, and you owe

279
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:45,689
no one an excuse as to why you cannot do something.

280
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,984
Now, we've been raised

281
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:53,947
that we require an excuse on when you ask someone, "Hey, can you do this?

282
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,949
Can you meet me?

283
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:56,617
Can you.

284
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,076
No, I can't."

285
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,202
Oh, how come

286
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,078
you don't need to know how come.

287
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:02,039
I just cannot do it.

288
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,959
It's powerful when you accept that, that you just say no, and that's that.

289
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,421
You, at least I did, get a little uncomfortable when

290
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:15,177
I would get pushed back on that, and I don't get uncomfortable anymore.

291
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,179
I mean, Noah's no.

292
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,933
You don't you don't need to know what's going on in my life, know is no.

293
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,813
And then you want to create what I call

294
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,232
the fuck it bucket list.

295
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,568
Create a list of

296
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,698
no pressure activities that might make you feel good.

297
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,201
A 10 minute walk.

298
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,871
Doodling, arts, crafts, paintings, slowly tearing sheets of paper.

299
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,166
Fuck, what a relaxing sensation it

300
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,919
is to tear sheets of paper.

301
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,672
I don't waste paper, though.

302
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,675
I use the already wasted resources of the 5 billion

303
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:58,720
unsolicited paper shit I get in my mailbox daily.

304
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:04,393
Maybe we should start boxing that up and shipping it back to the post office.

305
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,728
I wonder if we all did that, if it would stop.

306
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,440
Call a friend who actually gets you.

307
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,943
Dance in your kitchen..

308
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,989
Watch a lame ass comedy movie, all things that can pull you out

309
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,367
if you're feeling crappy.

310
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,453
Another good thing is

311
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,039
is to catch the negative thought pattern.

312
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,960
So when your brain is starting to doom spiral,

313
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,589
if you can recognize that spiral and then

314
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:37,676
change what you tell yourself about the spiral.

315
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,179
Not, fuck, I'm spiraling.

316
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,431
Here we go.

317
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,682
It's done, the day has ruined..

318
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,935
I'm struggling right now, and that's okay.

319
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,939
I will use the tools in my resource box and

320
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:56,194
maybe call a friend or two who gets me and can talk me down and help me through this.

321
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,949
You need to think of your energy like a

322
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,454
currency, sadly, in a bank.

323
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,916
Some things we do or done to us

324
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,211
deposit energy into our bank.

325
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:18,300
And then some things that we do and that are done

326
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:23,221
to us withdraw money. from that bank.

327
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,682
Toxic people

328
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:29,311
doom scrolling, overworking,

329
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,688
excessively putting needs before

330
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,568
your own at the expense of your

331
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,614
health, push, push, push, push, grind, grind, grind, side hustle, going,

332
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,950
going, going, until you enter burnout.

333
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:45,202
Burnout's not fun.

334
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:49,539
Make a list, try to track the things that

335
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:53,210
fill you up versus drain you.

336
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,964
You cannot pour from an empty cup.

337
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,426
It's not about being perfect.

338
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,930
It's about being slightly less shitty to yourself.

339
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,684
We need to be nicer to ourselves.

340
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:14,398
Some days, strategic self care might just mean you survived the fucking day.

341
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,400
And you know what?

342
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,359
That counts.

343
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,860
That's a Gold Star sticker on the board.

344
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:24,199
I think we negate that for

345
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,703
some people just surviving the day,

346
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,206
took up every resource they had.

347
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,795
So, how do people,

348
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,132
whether content creators, whatever we are, balance

349
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,969
consistency with our personal wellbeing.

350
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,390
What things or responsibilities do we owe

351
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:55,439
to our audiences or whomever versus what we owe to ourselves?

352
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,443
I owe you me.

353
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,195
That's it.

354
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,448
I owe you my authentic self.

355
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,453
And I cannot be anything other than me.

356
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,332
And when I'm not at my best, I cannot provide

357
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:17,961
you or anyone, me, or my best.

358
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,840
Is Wes than best okay?

359
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:26,345
Fuck, yes, it is.Cause we can't always be our best 247 365.

360
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,472
We're human, it's not possible.

361
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,932
You will get burnt out.

362
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,185
Physical fatigue

363
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,938
or mental blurs, which are painful.

364
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,191
We simply can't do it.

365
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:45,739
What if taking care of yourself is your most important work?

366
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:52,371
And how can we create environment that normalize

367
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,456
mental health breaks?

368
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,710
You are more than the sum of your output.

369
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,171
We all are.

370
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,800
One way way to kind

371
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:08,470
of tackle this is to

372
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:12,099
recognize the symbol or symbols, recognize the signals

373
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,686
in your body with five simple questions.

374
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,482
I hate the phrase to be present,

375
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:24,945
but being present in your body kind of is what we need to

376
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,781
combat mental health.

377
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,952
You can keep a log or a journal if you need to, or an app.

378
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,163
Everything's an app now, and kind of track your

379
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,417
not triggers, but yellow flags

380
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:44,005
on the field, if you will, kind of an early alerting system to

381
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:49,928
help keep track and point out when you might need to take a pause

382
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,224
by doing a self-check in.

383
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:58,812
If you're feeling away and or

384
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:04,234
are unsure why you're feeling that way, or maybe you don't even know what you're feeling

385
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,946
I've been there, it's kind of a bitch.

386
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,198
But try this.

387
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,408
Try it.

388
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,075
You never know.

389
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:12,742
It works for me.

390
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,285
Try it.

391
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,703
Five questions.

392
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,454
Have I eaten?

393
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,166
Have I had any water in the past two to three hours?

394
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,961
Do I have to use the bathroom when I've been holding it all this time?

395
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,172
Am I tired?

396
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,174
Does my body hurt?

397
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,260
Five simple questions, right?

398
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,179
Okay, let's dive in.

399
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,097
So, have I eaten?

400
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,974
Everyone heard hangry?

401
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,185
Oh, this person's hangry because they haven't eaten.

402
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,145
Well, let's talk about why.

403
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,316
Your brain consumes about 20

404
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:49,696
to 25, maybe percent of your body's energy.

405
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:54,034
So you need to constantly fuel it, provide your brain fuel.

406
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,994
Your blood sugar

407
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,705
affects your cognitive functioning.

408
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,168
Low blood sugar can trigger the stress hom

409
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:07,714
the stress hormone, our good old friend cortisol,

410
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,801
which can cause reduced attention span, increased irritability

411
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,721
and decreased self-control.

412
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,183
So your attention span shit.

413
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:24,731
You are heightened, irritable, and you have less self control.

414
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,192
What do you think is going to happen?

415
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:34,199
Number two, have I had any water without the past two to three hours?

416
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,911
Now, as I told Sarah in the last episode, you know,

417
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,330
your bodies are 50,000% water, so

418
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,708
what do we need to do here?

419
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,799
2% dehydration, just 2% dehydration

420
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:56,513
causes. 10

421
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,684
to 15% cognitive performance decline.

422
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,647
Your short- term memory kind of becomes shit

423
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,944
More cortisol, baby, is squirted into the body.

424
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:16,366
Your neural processing slows, you know, that thing that we really need to function.

425
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,952
And your concentration is reduced.

426
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,956
The brain, about 73% water,

427
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:28,670
dehydration increases neural energy expenditure.

428
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,507
That means your brain is doing more with West than it needs to.

429
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:38,471
A lack of water reduces your brain's ability to

430
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:42,225
sustain optimal electrical firing.

431
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,438
Food and water are important.

432
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,192
The third one, do I have to use the bathroom?

433
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,445
Mm.

434
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,195
Okay.

435
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:57,324
So physical discomfort increases your cognitive load.

436
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,284
More shits on your plate now.

437
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:03,538
Bladder tension activates a stress response.

438
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,540
And what does that do?

439
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,083
Cortesol!

440
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,711
It reduces your working memory capacity

441
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,213
and increases distraction and anxiety.

442
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:17,344
It can trigger a quite popular response that I work learned not too recently

443
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,681
or not too long ago, all courtesy

444
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:25,935
of our sympathetic nervous system, fight or flight.

445
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,315
Stress and anxiety, you know, the two main requirements for the

446
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:35,487
brain to make the cocktail of doom that I call it, and activate fight or flight.

447
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,947
What's that do?

448
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,033
It increases your heart rate, it increases your brain breathing rate, it increases

449
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,494
your blood pressure, it narrows your blood vessels.

450
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,622
It improves your eyesight and slows digestion.

451
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,833
I assume those are for the either fighting or flighting.

452
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,835
I guess it'd be either.

453
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:51,628
I'm not sure.

454
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,214
And it's activated when you're stressed in danger, or just physically active

455
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,550
It's now for some nerd.

456
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,804
It originates in your thoracic and oneumbar

457
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,432
regions of your spinal c cord, and it uses nor epinephrine

458
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:08,186
to act on the targeted issues, or targeted tissues, sorry.

459
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:12,190
It's one of two divisions of the autonomic

460
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:16,778
nervous system, along with the parasympathetic nervous system.

461
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:20,198
B. This system, the sympathetic,

462
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,827
responds to changes in caloric intake.

463
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,829
Okay?

464
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:26,162
So you've not eaten.

465
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,330
So, example

466
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,916
you have a caloric restriction that decreases

467
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:34,712
the sympathetic nervous system activity, while carbs increases it.

468
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,466
And for all of you fellasellow coffee lovers, caffeine

469
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:42,429
can also stimulate the sympathetic nervous system.

470
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:46,683
Four am I tired?

471
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:53,440
Sweep deprivation, mimics alcohol impairment.

472
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:57,026
Many studies here, 17 to 19

473
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,362
hours consistently being awake

474
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:03,450
is the equivalent of 0.05%

475
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,453
blood alcohol content, BAC.

476
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,456
And what's that do?

477
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,791
Well, it reduces emotional regulation, which then

478
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,169
increases emotional reactivity.

479
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:18,173
It reduces your complex problem solving,

480
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:22,218
your reaction time, your decision making accuracy,

481
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,472
and it increases impulsive behavior.

482
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,851
So one, two, three, and four are all kind of playing along with

483
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,687
each other here, really, really, really fucking you.

484
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,941
Then we come down to number five, does my body hurt?

485
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:42,322
You should track the patterns in your energy,

486
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,450
your mood, and your give a fucks bucket capacity.

487
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:50,163
Create a personal dashboard of your mental health indicators

488
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,832
in your mind if possible, or you can make a physical one.

489
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,792
We can talk about that later.

490
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,169
Chronic pain

491
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,923
Activates your brain's threat detection system.

492
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,551
It knows there's a problem, which now increases your

493
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,638
cognitive load again due to your brain focusing on

494
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:11,184
trying to determineermine the source, the cause?

495
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,144
Is it bad?

496
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:13,895
Is it temporary?

497
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:14,896
Do I need to stop what I'm doing?

498
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,981
Do I need to go to the hospital, et cetera.

499
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:21,903
It reduces your prefrontal cortex functionality,

500
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,406
and that controls executive functioning, working memory

501
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,536
regulating, and changing behavior,

502
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:33,081
decision making, balancing rewards, and goals,

503
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,709
meaning a instant gratification versus a long-term

504
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:41,589
goal, predicting consequences and focusing attention.

505
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,591
It also triggers

506
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:48,680
our longtime friend again, cortisol, that awesome stress hormone.

507
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,933
And what does that affect?

508
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,727
Attention, working memory, and emotional processing.

509
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,856
So those five things that seem kind

510
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:03,194
of small can truly affect your mood.

511
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,530
Have I eaten?

512
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,323
Have I had any water in the past two to three hours?

513
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,451
Do I have to use the bathroom and been holding it?

514
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,079
Am I tired?

515
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,206
And does my body hurt?

516
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,458
So what do we do with this?

517
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,462
Well, I did something that I

518
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:24,173
learned in therapy

519
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,720
and it's to build a toolk kit.

520
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,639
And it's not, it doesn't have to be tangible.

521
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,017
It doesn't have to be something physical you carry around.

522
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,227
It does help, but it doesn't have to be.

523
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:43,693
And you just need to develop three to five minute little things.

524
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,697
Five of them at least.

525
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,157
That way it's a 15 minute type of deal.

526
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:52,911
To kind of help you reboot, reset, reign

527
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,456
with yourself, realign with what you know is true to you.

528
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:02,462
One of them, I'm sure you've heard is a sensory grounding techniques.

529
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:08,051
People use different things, things in their pocket.

530
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,387
For me, I have a necklace

531
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,765
that you can't see around my neck that I use

532
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,934
It's a, well, here, I'll just pull it out.

533
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,936
You may not be able to see it.

534
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:20,939
It's a little green heart

535
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,818
locket type of deal. and it's got some

536
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,945
of my grand grandma's ashes in it.

537
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,408
So wherever you are, if possible, look

538
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,079
around, find some things you can focus on for a minute or two, like a

539
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:41,084
lamp, a stain on the wall, a pencil, that's under your a table, a parked car, a dog shitting on your walln.

540
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,086
It doesn't matter what it is

541
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:46,881
Just focus on it and then describe

542
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,925
it out loud.

543
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,096
Describe some features of it,

544
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,348
and if you can, touch it.

545
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,767
But not the dog example.

546
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,769
Don't touch that.

547
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,561
Don't touch that.

548
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,481
Concrete tangible things, something you can physically

549
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:07,944
connect with, seems to work much, much, much better than non tangible things.

550
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:13,282
and words have power, especially when counteracting

551
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,702
mental health and talking to yourself.

552
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,580
I'm not sure why saying stuff out loud

553
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,459
sticks more than if I just try to remember it

554
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:27,714
or write it down somewhere and then never going back and looking at it again.

555
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,885
Meditation with scheduled

556
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:37,724
mini breaks is another amazing thing to have in your toolbox.

557
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,769
You don't have to meditate for 15, 20, 30 minutes a day.

558
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,732
You don't have to own and do you don't have to do that

559
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,360
It can be anything that

560
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,114
clears your mind and has no

561
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,117
distractions to allow you to just

562
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:03,374
E. Just B. It could be in a room with some music.

563
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,794
It could be in a room with no music, some incense,

564
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:11,966
a favorite blanket, a favorite food, a flower, a lamp, whatever you need to center

565
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,677
do it.

566
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,721
And then two more really important ones

567
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:21,726
for this toolk kit is get the fuck up and move brakes.

568
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,728
You need to get up and move.

569
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,938
I don't, and I need to do this more.

570
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,191
You need to get up and move.

571
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,778
When you sit or away

572
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,447
all the time, all the time.

573
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,533
Your body hates you.

574
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,952
Your circulatory system hates you.

575
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:46,209
You're not at the prime circulation that you really should be having.

576
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,629
We need to walk and move and stretch

577
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:56,677
minimum, 10, 15 minutes a day, I'd say, three times a day.

578
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,598
And it doesn't have to be some sweat your ass

579
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,769
off exertion, you know, heat stroke type of deal.

580
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,729
Just

581
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,939
walk the perimeter of the inside of your apartment.

582
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,899
I've done that.

583
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,276
Walk back and forth and pace.

584
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,237
I've done that.

585
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,699
Go outside and walk around your house or your apartment or whatever.

586
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,952
Just get up and move.

587
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,454
Or

588
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,207
sit on the floor and do some stretching.

589
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:32,672
All of that releases the endorphins that help make you feel better or can help make you feel better.

590
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,217
And the last one is the boundary setting scripts.

591
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,804
People have can have some issues

592
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,182
setting boundaries, but more importantly,

593
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,435
they have a lot of issues coming up with what the boundary should

594
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:51,816
be, not so much setting it and enacting it or enforcing it, I should say.

595
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,862
So it'd be good to come up with a few short little things

596
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,241
remind you that you have

597
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,368
boundaries yourself.

598
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,787
You have boundaries with yourself.

599
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,124
So have some of those little boundaries in

600
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,627
your little toolk kit and remind yourself, hey,

601
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,088
Christopher, you set up this boundary.

602
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,216
Yeah, I know, but no, you set this up.

603
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,469
because you don't want this to happen again

604
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,931
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

605
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,725
Okay, I need to do that.

606
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:30,146
So they're not necessarily scripts for setting boundariesaries with other people.

607
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,148
They're the ones that you have set with yourself

608
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,694
to help stay aligned with who you are.

609
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,697
Just reminders, we're human.

610
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,826
We're gonna fall, we're gonna fail, or a happy mistake.

611
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,913
Sorry, it's not a fail or a happy accident.

612
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,915
Because it can always be

613
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,666
spun a different way.

614
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:55,296
Well, spun a different way, meaning not how the media does.

615
00:36:55,296 --> 00:37:00,134
Whatever else you need to add to your toolk kit, you can.

616
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,136
Absolutely.

617
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,015
And something else that will really, really

618
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,477
help is to reframe what productivity is.

619
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,523
No matter what you do, what your task is, you

620
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:18,194
don't want to put everything on

621
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:21,739
the quantitative, right?

622
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,699
Quantity.

623
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,325
How much did I do?

624
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,368
How much did I put out this day?

625
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,370
How

626
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,454
Don't.

627
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,206
That's not a measure of how good you are.

628
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,291
It's not the quantity.

629
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,461
It's the qualitative, the quality.

630
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:39,924
Did you put out a whole bunch bunch great, but it's all shit?

631
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,010
Or were you able to put out one thing

632
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,721
and it's great?

633
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,473
Where's the balance?

634
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,811
It's. best if you

635
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,398
can do one thing that's good versus

636
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:59,235
10 to 15 things that are counterproductive and not good.

637
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,280
So if you can reframe it in your

638
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,617
mind to, it's not about how much I do, it's

639
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,495
about how well I'm doing.

640
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:16,711
And that helps you challenge the internalized capitalistic bullshit myths that have been bred into us.

641
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:22,550
And recognizing rest as active recovery

642
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,469
not a weakness.

643
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,972
Rest is not a weakness.

644
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,683
Create an accountability

645
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,103
with a comparison, so to speak.

646
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:37,273
So find one to two people or three,

647
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:42,945
whoever, who really understand your mental health, the journey you're on, and how

648
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:47,283
people should treat and respond to you so so

649
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:50,202
that you can give them your best.

650
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,040
And we actually talked about this an episode or

651
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,709
two ago with my guest, Brandon.

652
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,421
I think, or C season two, or maybe three, I'm not sure.

653
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,674
You need to build support systems that validate

654
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:07,762
you, that validate your needs, that validate who you are.

655
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,722
You need that.

656
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,433
If you don't have that,

657
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,436
you're not going to be happy.

658
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,690
You need people in your life who get you.

659
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:25,196
And they don't like Eor,

660
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:29,450
somewhat of an okay example, Eor and Winnie the Pooh, right?

661
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:33,204
Chronically depressed, chronically sad and down.

662
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,376
and all of his friends know this, but they're still his friends.

663
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,336
They don't judge him for it.

664
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,672
And they don't try to change him for it.

665
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,925
They.

666
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,009
They don't try to change Eor.

667
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:50,721
They don't try to make fun of Eor.

668
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,681
It's just

669
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,933
That's our friend Eor.

670
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:58,687
Mental health, he's sad, depressed, pretty much most of the time.

671
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,190
But we love them.

672
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,402
We love Eor, and we're gonna stick with Eor.

673
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,362
Those friends are key.

674
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,072
Finding people like that are key key

675
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,449
Very, very, very key.

676
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,205
So we have some adaptive strategies.

677
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,709
Lovely word, to kind of help fight

678
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:25,923
this grind, grind, grind, burnout culture.

679
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,427
Build a flexible

680
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,472
plan, contingency plan, if you will,

681
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,936
for your job, if you have a job,

682
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:42,940
your personal life, creative projects, whatever you're doing.

683
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,443
Allow yourself to mess up.

684
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,447
Allow yourself to make a mess.

685
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,828
Someone told me that. the other day when I

686
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,206
was in a not great place and dealing

687
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:04,003
with art, 'cause I'm trying to paint more,

688
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:08,174
and it just enages me because it's not what I see in my head on

689
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,926
the canvas.

690
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,012
And it enrages me.

691
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:16,265
And then I was told, allow yourself to make a mess.

692
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,267
You're still learning.

693
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,144
Allow yourself to mess it up.

694
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,146
You're still learning.

695
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,190
And I think

696
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:27,485
it enrages and bothers me so much is because

697
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,653
two things.

698
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:33,741
One, it's not really the artistic outlet.

699
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,701
That's me.

700
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,452
It's not my choice.

701
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,079
It's It's fun, but that's not my choice.

702
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,209
And that's one reason.

703
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,503
And the second reason is because

704
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:53,469
I'm not excelling at it as quickly as I did with piano.

705
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,306
And the two of those reasons combined

706
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,726
really cost them spiraling in my head.

707
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:05,940
Like, for instanceance, when I finished the one over here, I threw it on the floor.

708
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,943
I just didn't give a fuck, because it just doesn't

709
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,195
look like what I had in my head.

710
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,115
But as I sit here right now and I'm looking over at it, and different

711
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:19,870
lighting at a different angle, it doesn't look bad.

712
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,206
It really doesn't.

713
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,709
But it's not what I wanted.

714
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,170
But it's not bad.

715
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:33,342
So, I don't always get what we want, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be bad

716
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,929
either.

717
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,807
So create some buffer zones, create breaks,

718
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,893
and whatever you do so that you can quickly regroup, set

719
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:46,272
an alarm on your phone for every so many, whatever, an hour, two hours

720
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,233
and do it.

721
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,901
Don't, oh, I don't feel like I need one right now.

722
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,861
Do it.

723
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,321
Every time you put, I don't feel like I need it.

724
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,282
I don't feel, oh, I can go a little longer.

725
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,866
I can go a little longer.

726
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:58,742
I can go a little longer.

727
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,827
You're gonna crash.

728
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,036
You're gonna burn out.

729
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,079
It happens.

730
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,956
Listen to your body.

731
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,459
It doesn't lie.

732
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:13,215
Practice communicating changes proactively

733
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,719
with people, even if

734
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,763
looking in the mirror and starting with yourself.

735
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,641
And I actually recommend you do start with yourself.

736
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:27,104
It was cheesy as hell when I tried it, I'm not going to lie.

737
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:32,109
And it did kind of make me think of that Bloody Mary thing looking in the mirror growing up.

738
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,111
But anyhow, I digress.

739
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,779
Start with your yourself.

740
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,908
If there are changes you want to make and say

741
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,202
you have a list, and it's kind of a daunting list,

742
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:47,207
pick one or two things, maybe

743
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:52,212
even just one, and tell yourself about it.

744
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,673
Have a conversation with yourself.

745
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,925
It's okay.

746
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:02,348
It's the one person you can talk to, that you kind of know how they're going to respond.

747
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,475
So it's okay.

748
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,435
Talk to yourself.

749
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,354
If you want to look in the mirror, do it, if you want to look into your phone, do it,

750
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:11,732
just have a conversation with yourself.

751
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,611
And I don't mean internally in your head.

752
00:44:15,652 --> 00:44:17,988
I mean out loud.

753
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,867
Why?

754
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,535
There is something to talking out

755
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:27,456
loud that makes it stick.

756
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:34,213
Something like writing when we used to have to write things 50% ofajillion times, you remembered it.

757
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,965
I don't mean like writing sentences when you got in trouble, because.

758
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:43,222
Anyway, I just mean writing things down like in school, taking notes and stuff.

759
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:46,266
I did retain it longer if I wrote it down

760
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:49,395
versus putting it in my head, which is just a

761
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:53,774
shit mess trying to remember things and organize.

762
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,776
But writing it down made it stick.

763
00:44:55,776 --> 00:45:00,280
Something else you can do is I don't have one.

764
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,867
I need to build it back up, an emergency mental health fund so

765
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,871
that you can treat yourself whenever you need.

766
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,958
I'm not saying retail therapy.

767
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,919
I'm just saying if you're having an exceptionally

768
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,589
bad time or something and you have some, you know,

769
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:21,093
mental health fundage,, get something,

770
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:24,972
whatever it is, get something that will help you

771
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:28,767
And I'm not here to tell you what you should

772
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,437
or should not get with your mental health fund.

773
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,773
That's up to you.

774
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,109
Only you know what's going to help you.

775
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:42,364
You also want to negotiate,

776
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:46,660
well, this shit's all over the place, negotiate flexible working arrangements,

777
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:51,874
and explore, you know, resources that are available to you

778
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,961
at your job if you are working.

779
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,757
Another big thing is changing how

780
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:04,511
you see yourself, changing how you think about mental health

781
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:09,600
the stigma, the stereotypes,

782
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:13,353
the words people use when talking about mental health.

783
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:21,195
your worth is not the sum of your output.

784
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:25,199
What you can do is not who you are.

785
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,701
What you can do

786
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:32,664
is not what makes you your give you value and your worth.

787
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,625
You're more than that.

788
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,214
Sustainability trumps intensity.

789
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,927
Vulnerability is a superpower.

790
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,929
It is not a weakness.

791
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:50,182
It's scary as thought to be vulnerable

792
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:55,854
Not going to lie, I will agree with everyone who just screamed yes on that.

793
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,398
But it's not a weakness.

794
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,359
It's not.

795
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,527
You can't really grow

796
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,197
if you're not vulnerable and take that chance.

797
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,699
You can't.

798
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,453
So all of this said.

799
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:18,460
Write down some sentences, maybe, or you can type them up.

800
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,547
That's fine if you wanted to type them up on your computer.

801
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:29,221
and you can start it with I am more, whatever.

802
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,932
I am more than

803
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,935
whatever.

804
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:38,188
And make sure it's things that have to do with your life.

805
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,985
You know, I am more than a pretty little butterfly.

806
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,237
It's cute, yes, we get it.

807
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,239
But

808
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,532
you're not physically a butterfly.

809
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:51,952
So try to make these something about you in

810
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:55,163
your life to help you reinforce, and you

811
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:58,667
want to say these out loud, to help you reinforce

812
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,421
you.

813
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:07,384
Help you reinforce you, your

814
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:12,472
strengths, who you are, who you want to be, where you want to go.

815
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:18,937
I went ahead and made a whist more than I thought, and you don't have to make this many.

816
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,442
But I did.

817
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,443
I did.

818
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,193
I'm going to share it with you.

819
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:31,825
But I'm actually going to change it from I am to

820
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:39,082
UR. for the ones that are kind of like a blanket statement that go to everybody.

821
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,836
And then I'll change them back to I am for the ones that specifically pertain to my life

822
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,797
which most are I am.

823
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,216
Okay, so here's some.

824
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,177
And remember, you want to say these out loud.

825
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:55,974
You are more than the stories that people have said about you.

826
00:48:56,975 --> 00:49:00,354
You are more than the labels that people tried

827
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,689
to define and swap on you.

828
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:08,695
You are more than the skills that provided you income.

829
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,200
You are more than the challenges that made you.

830
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:19,331
100% of the shit that life throughout you, you survived.

831
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,333
You're still here.

832
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:27,923
I am more than the classical pianist who lost the majority of his hearing.

833
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:32,969
I am more than the person who had perfect pitch and

834
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:38,642
tuned your instrument when no other resources were available to do so.

835
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:44,940
I am more than an IT genius who

836
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,442
can make technology bend at my will.

837
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,531
I am more than the traumas that said,

838
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,701
you're not enough and you're not going to be enough enough.

839
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,455
I am the symphony of my own resilience.

840
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:06,253
I am the code that rewrites its own algorithm that refuses to be predictable and fit in.

841
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:09,715
I am am the glitch in your perfect fucked up system.

842
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:15,345
We are the static between your neat little categories.

843
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,890
We are the scream that you try to silence.

844
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:22,185
We are the noise that refuses to be silenced.

845
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:27,733
I am the trauma that gave me my goddamn voice.

846
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,988
We try, we fail.

847
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,950
We rupture, we break.

848
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,203
We try.

849
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,664
We fail..

850
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,708
We try.

851
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,169
We break through.

852
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,421
We rebuild.

853
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,174
We try.

854
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,428
I am human.

855
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,181
I am mental health.

856
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:03,018
We are human, and

857
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,228
we are mental health.

858
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:12,736
Pick whatever sentences that

859
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:16,615
resonate with you, things that people may have told you

860
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:22,454
opposite of what you know to be true, use those if you need to.

861
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,958
Make as many as you need and read them to yourself.

862
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:30,420
Out loud in front of a mirror,

863
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,215
if you can.

864
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:36,885
It can seem a little hokey at first, so maybe just start reading them out loud.

865
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,887
Or, you know what?

866
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,472
Hey, even just start reading them to yourself quietly.

867
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,724
Start there.

868
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,268
Eventually, you'll see you're going to start saying them out loud.

869
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,438
Like, something's going to happen during the day and you're going to be like, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

870
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,943
I am the symphony of my own resilience, not you.

871
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,863
And then you'll start saying them and saying them, and then

872
00:51:56,863 --> 00:52:00,200
they become second nature, and then you have weapons,

873
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,702
you have mental health weapons to combat

874
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:07,707
bullshit that I like to call wife.

875
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:13,421
So, that's really all I had today.

876
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:17,717
to let people know you do not have to

877
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:22,472
grind, you can take time for your mental health.

878
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,601
You cannot be your best if you're not at your best.

879
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,771
And even if you're not at your all best, you can still give

880
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,440
not your all best, and it still be enough.

881
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,193
That's okay.

882
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:39,739
Just take the time to do what

883
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:43,326
you need to do to be the better you

884
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:46,705
and fuck everybody else.

885
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,665
They're not you.

886
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,709
They're not living your life.

887
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,460
They're not walking in your shoes.

888
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,379
They're not putting up with your family.

889
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,339
They're not putting up with your friends

890
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,758
They're not putting up with your medical issues.

891
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:03,179
So why are we going to aot them some of our energy?

892
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:08,935
You, have the conversation with yourself.

893
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:13,648
And I think you're going to be pleasantly

894
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:18,195
surprised if you can follow through with it and do it.

895
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:23,074
So feel free to send questions,

896
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:26,536
comments about any of the topics that

897
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,497
I've discussed or we've discussed on the show.

898
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:33,001
And if they're appropriate for the podcast and

899
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:36,713
with your permission, we'll go ahead and discuss them.

900
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,007
And when I say appropriate

901
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:43,762
you know, there's always someone who's going to send in something that, no,

902
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:47,098
so I hate hate having to vet shit like

903
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,684
that, but, you know, this is the world we live in.

904
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,729
So thanks for joining me.

905
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,690
And we'll see you next week.

906
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,943
Hopefully.

907
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,320

908
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,948
