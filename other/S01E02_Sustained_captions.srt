1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,211
Hey, humans, thanks for joining my podcast.

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:09,050
This podcast is a place to share unedited lived experiences regarding mental health.

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,178
We'll touch on how it shows up in our lives and provide

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,474
some tips that have worked for me and others on how to manage it.

5
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,898
There will be strong language, and definitely the

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,943
potential for disturbing and or triggering content.

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:30,280
Please be aware of this and mindful of

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,407
others who may be in earshot.

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,036
Most importantly, and as horribly fucking

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,206
cliche as this sounds, you really do not have to go through this alone.

11
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,961
And hopefully you'll see this and feel this more and more as you listen.

12
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:49,132
And hey, if this podcast isn't for you, that's fine.

13
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,134
There are lots of them out there.

14
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,471
Find one that speaks to you and helps you.

15
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,432
So, let's talk mental health.

16
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,460
And now the boiler plate and cover your ass claws

17
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:31,090
On this podcast, unless explicitly stated,

18
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,511
no one on this show is a medical professional in

19
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,889
any way, and as such, no content on

20
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:41,893
this show is intended to be, whether implied or otherwise,

21
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,145
to be taken as medical advice.

22

00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:01,097
Hey, Humans, thanks for joining us last week,

39
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:06,686
Eis episode two, conducting through chaos when your relationship with symphony plays and a toxic key.

40
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,646
I had some thoughts on that.

41
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,232
So I went ahead and recorded some things and I'm going to play them right after this.

42
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,944
Um, I want to thank you for your support and tuning in

43
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,364
Join me and my guest, Brandon

44
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,910
again next week for living in a new

45
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:25,455
key breaking free from life's opus.

46
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:31,127
When someone tells me, he's

47
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,422
not doing anything to hurt you directly, I have to take a minute.

48
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,382
I have to.

49
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,386
and point out the privilege and how

50
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:44,599
it can blind us to the horribly subtle

51
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,102
ways hatred spreads throughout our world.

52
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,940
Now, I know I probably just lost so someone, if not more,

53
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:55,944
I don't see how they're still following me, when I use the word privilege.

54
00:03:56,277 --> 00:04:00,031
Well, don't freak out, because the next word's white privilege.

55
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,991
Yeah, go ahead.

56
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,620
Run to your mom, pop that tit back in your mouth, because you can't think for yourself

57
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,207
So, throughout history, some of our

58
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:13,753
darkest chapters, it did not begin with, you know, outright violence.

59
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,215
They just began with tiny, tiny little words.

60
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,302
And then the gradual normalization of viewing

61
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,721
certain groups as, you know, other.

62
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:28,017
Before that Holocaust, it

63
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,478
started with little tiny changes.

64
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,856
Casual, anti- Semitic remarks becoming

65
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:37,485
acceptable in quote unquote poloite society

66
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,614
small discriminatory policies that seem

67
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:46,286
insignificant in isolation and the

68
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,206
quiet erosion of protections that people assumed would always be there.

69
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:55,253
Before the expansion of American slavery,

70
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,172
it wasn't just about the brutal practice itself.

71
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:02,343
It was about the rhetoric that dehumanized black people.

72
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,806
So for those of you who got pissed off at that white privilege,

73
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:11,811
rhetoric is a noun, and it means the art of

74
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,732
effective or persuasive speaking or writing, especially

75
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:20,194
the use of figures of speech and other compositional techniques.

76
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,698
Now, compositional is an adjective

77
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,744
and in this context, meaning what we're

78
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,205
talking about, compositional means composed

79
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:35,251
of various elements, meaning more than one thing,

80
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,462
unlike what your brain can handle.

81
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,424
The pseudoscience that justified

82
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:45,136
their treatment, I can have a whole podcast on that alone.

83
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,138
Fucking idiots.

84
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,600
The social acceptance of viewing them as less than human.

85
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,895
One more time, the social acceptance

86
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,607
of viewing them as less than human..

87
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:01,486
This system thrived,

88
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,947
not just through direct violence, but also through the silent

89
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,284
approval of everyone who looked away.

90
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,286
Everyone who turned their head.

91
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,704
It's not going to affect me.

92
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,206
Why do I give a shit?

93
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,958
Today, when I look at my life, a

94
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:22,423
gay man, I see echoes of this.

95
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,594
When people who are in charge use their dog

96
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,847
whistles and coded language, when they embolden

97
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,226
those who denyy humanity,

98
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:38,189
when they roll back protections for marginalized communities,

99
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,067
they don't need to target us directly.

100
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,696
They simply need to create an environment where

101
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,450
your nasty ass discrimination feels and is

102
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:54,205
acceptable, where your hatred feels justified,

103
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,958
where your bigotry feels normal

104
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,754
because you don't know who you are or how to think you

105
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:06,467
have to hurt other people, which goes to that saying, hurt people, hurt people.

106
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,764
Every time someone who holds power suggests

107
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,101
that my love is less valid than anyone

108
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:20,690
else's, or that my rights don't matter or that my rights are up for debate.

109
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,442
You're giving permission.

110
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,196
You're giving permission to hate, permission to discriminate, permission

111
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:31,492
to harm, permission to hurt, permission to kill.

112
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,038
Permission to act on your dark

113
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:40,209
impulses that civil rights progress we thought or

114
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:44,422
should have, I should say, pushed back into the shadows.

115
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,675
So, no.

116
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,929
Maybe, you know, maybe he's not doing anything to hurt me directly.

117
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,436
When you ask me, why are you butt hurt?

118
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,438
Why are you worried?

119
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,483
He's not doing anything to you directly.

120
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,863
But yet they're creating this world where they

121
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,950
feel empowered to do this discriminatory bullshit.

122
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,705
And that, right right there, that's how every

123
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,709
single systemic oppression in history began.

124
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,047
Not with a bang, not with a huge war, not,

125
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,341
not with not with a memo, okay?

126
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,301
Did you get the memo?

127
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,093
Have you seen my stapler?

128
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,053
No.

129
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:36,557
Just a whisper, just some words, just, oh, they're different than us.

130
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,559
What do you think about that?

131
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,185
Oh, maybe we should do this.

132
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,269
That's how it starts.

133
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:49,445
The question is not whether someone is actively attacking you or us or anybody.

134
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:54,450
The question is whether they're making it easier for others to do the same.

135
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,080
And if you wait until this shit becomes

136
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,209
direct and blindingly undeniable,

137
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,171
well, we've already waited too long then.

138
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,176
So when someone asks you why your butt hurt, why

139
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:16,347
are you worried, he's not doing anything to hurt you directly.

140
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,726
Well, if

141
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:24,772
it's a friend, a family member, a preacher,

142
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:29,193
a pastor, a teacher, a quote unquote person of God.

143
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:32,071
The next time someone tells you, why are you butthurt?

144
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,031
They're not doing anything to you directly.

145
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,450
Don't don't get upset.

146
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,952
Don't freak out.

147
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,078
Don't get anxious.

148
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,204
Try not to have an adrenaline dump.

149
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,456
The truth.

150
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,709
Just tell them the truth.

151
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,168
Turn around.

152
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,671
Tell them the truth. speak to them like an adult.

153
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,673
Just say, you know what?

154
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,634
I hear your words, and

155
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,220
you're a stupid cunt.

156
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,931
Bye-bye.
