1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,059
Hey humans, thanks for joining my podcast.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,000
This podcast is a place to share unedited

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,960
lived experiences regarding mental health.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,580
We'll touch on how it shows up in

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,240
our lives and provide some tips that have

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,700
worked for me and others on how to

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,240
manage it.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,810
There will be strong language and definitely the

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,610
potential for disturbing and or triggering content.

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,270
Please be aware of this and mindful of

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,570
others who may be in earshot.

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,670
Most importantly, and as horribly fucking cliche as

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,210
this sounds, you really do not have to

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,130
go through this alone.

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,810
And hopefully you'll see this and feel this

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,670
more and more as you listen.

17
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,850
And hey, if this podcast isn't for you,

18
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:48,750
that's fine.

19
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,870
There are lots of them out there.

20
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,670
Find one that speaks to you and helps

21
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,310
you.

22
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,330
So let's talk mental health.

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,340
And now the boilerplate and cover your ass

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:25,900
clause.

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,580
On this podcast, unless explicitly stated, no one

26
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,300
on this show is a medical professional in

27
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,000
any way.

28
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,260
And as such, no content on this show

29
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,520
is intended to be, whether implied or otherwise,

30
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,080
to be taken as medical advice.

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,480

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,160

need.

52
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,560
Okay, welcome everybody.

53
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,660
In this first pilot episode, I thought what

54
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,400
better way to start than to share a

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,100
bit about myself and my mental health and

56
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,260
that lovely little journey down that witch's road.

57
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,040
There'll be good, there'll be bad, and of

58
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,040
course some really fucked up shit like earlier.

59
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,200
I have been diagnosed with bipolar, autism, ADHD,

60
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:39,380
CPTSD, borderline personality disorder, and anxiety disorder.

61
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,600
Since January of this year, 2024, as this

62
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,860
is recorded, I developed Meniere's disease and have

63
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,440
lost most of my hearing.

64
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,420
I've been through a lot of shit and

65
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,200
we're going to talk about some of it

66
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,720
today.

67
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,600
Yay!

68
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,040
So I spent many, many years feeling broken,

69
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,860
alone, isolated, like there was something fundamentally wrong

70
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,740
with me that I just could not figure

71
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,160
out.

72
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,940
It seemed that I didn't make friends quite

73
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,740
like other people I knew that made friends.

74
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,280
Theirs seemed to be genuine connections and mine

75
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,580
always kind of felt like a surface level.

76
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,380
I've always had a hard time connecting with

77
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,680
people in most ways that others don't.

78
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,300
And the more I am learning about mental

79
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,960
health and different conditions and traits, the more

80
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,220
I am realizing that I'm not broken.

81
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,700
None of us are.

82
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,180
Our brains are just slightly wired a little

83
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,320
differently than others and some are a touch

84
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,680
fucked.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,300
You know, you can't help it.

86
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,860
The upside of this though, and yeah, there's

87
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,860
an upside to some mental health things, and

88
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,220
one of them is due to the experiences

89
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,340
that I've had at least, it's allowed me

90
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,320
to kind of tune into things and be

91
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,660
more receptive and aware of things that some

92
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,820
people may not be.

93
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,840
Let me give you an example.

94
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,420
Let's say you go to a gathering.

95
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,920
Some people you know, the majority of them

96
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,620
there you know.

97
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
There might be some sprinkled in there that

98
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,560
you don't know.

99
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,580
Um, there's food, there's music, there's lots of

100
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,740
noise, there's drinks, adult beverages, non-adult beverages,

101
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,820
you know, there's wine glasses clinking, you've got

102
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,080
ice in a whiskey tumbler clinking around, and

103
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,980
you know, you're just kind of looking around

104
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,340
and taking it in and you know, getting

105
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,480
a feel for the environment.

106
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,780
I don't know about you, but for me,

107
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,820
the first thing I do in strange places

108
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,880
is look for exits and all of the

109
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,740
possible strategies to be able to get out

110
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,040
quickly if need be, whether an emergency or

111
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,820
something with my mental health and I just

112
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,560
need to go.

113
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,300
I don't know if anybody else does that,

114
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,600
but that is just something that I like

115
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:32,980
to do.

116
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,860
So, you're there, you're chilling, you're people watching,

117
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,240
you're chatting, maybe you're not, maybe you're just

118
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,560
sitting and only people watching, but you hear

119
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,200
something.

120
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,340
Whether a word, a phrase, a sentence, you

121
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,580
hear something, but the tone and volume is

122
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,980
just slightly different than the rest of the

123
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,640
tone and volume at that gathering.

124
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,100
And there could be 30, 40, 50 people

125
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,300
there all speaking and talking, but yet this

126
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,760
one instance, your ear picked up a different

127
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,440
tone and slight volume difference.

128
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,720
Now, for me, it's not an adrenaline dump,

129
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,480
it's not a trigger anymore, it used to

130
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,300
be, but it's not anymore.

131
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,140
It's more of kind of a superpower I

132
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,980
was talking about.

133
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,760
I'm alert, I know what I just heard

134
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,140
and then due to experience, I know the

135
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,780
potentials of what could come out of this.

136
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,140
So, you hear voices raised and you might

137
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,700
think, oh, okay, so not necessarily a heated

138
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,000
conversation, but just a lively conversation.

139
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,100
But there was something about that tone and

140
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,320
volume and what you heard from someone.

141
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,560
So, now you're on a little bit of

142
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,380
an alert, not hypervigilant, you're just slightly aware

143
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:24,000
that there is potential for something that you

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,840
have experienced in the past.

145
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,380
So, you kind of stay alert and carry

146
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,679
on with what you're doing and the voice

147
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,780
gets a little louder, the tone gets a

148
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,720
little more and then your fight or flight

149
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,520
system goes from standby to armed.

150
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,760
It is now ready for information from you

151
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,000
on whether you need to go or stay.

152
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,860
It's a very odd feeling when you are

153
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,560
somewhere having what feels like a good time

154
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,000
and then immediately fight or flight gets switched

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,960
to the armed mode, waiting for further input.

156
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,860
That's kind of a superpower.

157
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,960
I know it may not sound like one,

158
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,280
but it kind of is.

159
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,180
To have the experiences that we have had,

160
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,580
people with trauma, you are more in tune

161
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,100
to potential situations.

162
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,540
It's not that you are judging them immediately

163
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,360
and saying, oh, fuck, this is going to

164
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,780
happen because this happened.

165
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,060
No, our past does not necessarily dictate our

166
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,580
future.

167
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,980
You are just aware that this has happened

168
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,060
before and it could potentially happen again.

169
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,700
That's it.

170
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,260
That's all that is.

171
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,060
But learning to recognize that and trusting that

172
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,060
your brain is telling you, hey, let's be

173
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,880
a little mindful of this situation we just

174
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,800
heard, but not let it ruin the rest

175
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,000
of this gathering unless needed.

176
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,220
So you go on with what you're doing

177
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,860
and it turns out it's nothing.

178
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,620
It's just friends, you know, getting excited and

179
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,500
talking loudly over, I don't know, some sports

180
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,180
ball bullshit.

181
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,840
Who knows?

182
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,500
And it's nothing.

183
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,920
And then you're back to, you know, your

184
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,440
default state and your fight or flight is

185
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,920
no longer in armed mode.

186
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,320
It's now back to standby.

187
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,220
And that's kind of where I like to

188
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,600
live.

189
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,500
I like to be in standby and not

190
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,060
armed.

191
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,540
My fight or flight system has been stuck

192
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,440
on for decades.

193
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,300
And you can do the research.

194
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,900
It's very, very damaging, very damaging to your

195
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:16,620
body physically to have that stuck on for

196
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,380
so long.

197
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:27,080
Once you learn the triggers, once you figure

198
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,580
out the things that start to make you

199
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,120
feel a certain way, that's when things start

200
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,200
to become clearer and you're able to start

201
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,380
working to make things better.

202
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,500
Not necessarily better in that current situation, but

203
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,260
better for you and how your mind processes.

204
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,180
So all this is happening.

205
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,660
Now let's say it goes the opposite way.

206
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,420
The voices get louder and louder and it's

207
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,620
a more heated tone.

208
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,880
And you know it is definitely going to

209
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,680
be a very not pleasant time.

210
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,440
So what happens?

211
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,980
Well, our bodies have a massive adrenaline dump,

212
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,760
which is great.

213
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,300
You know, panic attack number 23,000 starts

214
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:16,780
to happen.

215
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,380
And I know you all know what I'm

216
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,980
talking about, but the most enraging part isn't

217
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,340
the horrible feeling that I'm going to pass

218
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,780
out or die or anything like that.

219
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,520
No, no, no, no, no.

220
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,780
For me, the enraging part is not knowing

221
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,660
what the was.

222
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,600
Now in this situation, it's the raised voices

223
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,300
and the yelling and the tone that that's

224
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,340
an easy one.

225
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,180
But when you're in situations and you cannot

226
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:55,540
figure out the trigger, that's, that's very enraging.

227
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,480
To put simply, that's very fucking enraging.

228
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,680
It's difficult to work on a trigger induced

229
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,380
panic attack when you seemingly cannot figure out

230
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,700
what the trigger is.

231
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,280
I've worked hard and I've identified quite a

232
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,860
few over the years for me.

233
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,020
But I still have one, just one that

234
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,720
gets me every single time.

235
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,460
And I cannot figure it out.

236
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,640
So picture it, Sicily 19.

237
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,360
No, I'm just kidding.

238
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,700
So picture this.

239
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,320
I'm at a restaurant.

240
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:33,680
Okay.

241
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,840
Um, and it's an Italian restaurant.

242
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,320
Um, it's full.

243
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,820
All the tables are full.

244
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,920
It's very loud.

245
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,080
There are lots of smells from home growing

246
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,500
up, lots of wine glasses, making noise, silverware

247
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,320
clanking, people scraping forks on their plates, like

248
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,400
nails on a chalkboard because they don't know

249
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,680
how to fucking eat in public.

250
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,920
So, you know, the usual restaurant shit.

251
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,340
Well, I still don't know what the trigger

252
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:03,800
was.

253
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,280
I don't know if it was a smell,

254
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,960
a sound, a color, a shape, a person,

255
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,700
someone's beard, how they looked, the smell of

256
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,080
my food, or a combination of all of

257
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,980
that, or just some of it.

258
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,860
I have no idea, but nonetheless, my body

259
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,060
remembered it and then boom, adrenaline dump right

260
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,440
then and there in the restaurant.

261
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,140
And I immediately wished I was not conscious

262
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,640
because I did not want to deal with

263
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,920
that again.

264
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,160
And I know you guys know what I

265
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,880
am describing.

266
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,100
I started to breathe deeper and it got

267
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,540
shallow.

268
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,780
I immediately got clammy and started sweating profusely.

269
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,380
Then the dizzy starts and then my ears

270
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,080
start ringing even louder.

271
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,740
You can barely hear the ambient sounds around

272
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,180
you now because your ringing is so loud.

273
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,880
My heart felt like it was in my

274
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,600
ears and then I get incredibly confused and

275
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,640
all of this is happening while your body

276
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
is telling you to jump out of your

277
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,560
skin and run away, which kind of feels

278
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,440
like you just got a huge shot of

279
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,780
steroids in your ass.

280
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,420
Yet your body itself doesn't want to move.

281
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,000
The muscles are like, nah, I'm good.

282
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,280
And it's almost paralyzing at times.

283
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,460
That adrenaline dump that happened is what's giving

284
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,620
you all this energy and sets your fight

285
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,140
or flight mode and it's ready for whatever

286
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,120
it's being told.

287
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,920
Yet sometimes it does whatever the fuck it

288
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,820
wants, regardless of what you told it.

289
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,900
It's controlled by the sympathetic nervous system and

290
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,820
when it's activated, all kinds of physiological shit

291
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,980
happens in your body.

292
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,200
It's as if every cell's powerhouse, mitochondria for

293
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,660
those who remember, have been tased, you know,

294
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,840
like a taser simultaneously.

295
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,820
But if you can burn off all that

296
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,680
adrenaline and noradrenaline, the panic attack will drastically

297
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,260
and quickly reduce.

298
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,020
I've done it.

299
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,960
It works for me.

300
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,170
Do jumping jacks.

301
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,310
Run around the house wherever you are.

302
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,630
If you're able to do something to burn

303
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,310
off that adrenaline because it also distracts you

304
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,590
from the said panic attack you're having and

305
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,050
likely at the very least it will shorten

306
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,450
it.

307
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,250
Something else that I noticed that worked for

308
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:50,570
me.

309
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,550
Luckily at this time I was in the

310
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,610
presence of a psychologist and they had me

311
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,410
take an ice cube out of my water

312
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,350
glass and put it in my hand and

313
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,810
close my hand and make a fist and

314
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,930
to focus on the cold sensation while focusing

315
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,890
on my breathing.

316
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,609
That also worked.

317
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,430
No rescue meds were needed.

318
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,930
I did not have to reach for one

319
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,910
of my pills and there are so many

320
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,569
techniques to pull yourself out of a panic

321
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,030
attack.

322
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,250
But let me be clear.

323
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:33,470
Everybody responds differently to different stimuli and the

324
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,110
same outcomes are not always guaranteed.

325
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:44,290
Always consult with a medical professional before you

326
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,390
decide to try something new.

327
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,750
Okay, that's all the time we have today.

328
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,490
Thank you everyone who joined and listened.

329
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,370
I truly hope you were able to take

330
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,630
something from this that will help you better

331
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,070
manage your mental health.

332
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,930
Please also keep in your mind that this

333
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,770
takes work and time.

334
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,770
There is no quick fix.

335
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,190
So please allow yourself some grace and compassion.

336
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,750
I hope you join again next time as

337
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,530
we continue dismantling the ridiculous stigma that surrounds

338
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,270
mental health.

339
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,430
And until next time, don't throat punch anyone.

340
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,930
Bye bye.
