1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,211
Hey, humans, thanks for joining my podcast.

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:09,050
This podcast is a place to share unedited lived experiences regarding mental health.

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,178
We'll touch on how it shows up in our lives and provide

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,474
some tips that have worked for me and others on how to manage it.

5
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,898
There will be strong language, and definitely the

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,943
potential for disturbing and or triggering content.

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:30,363
Please be aware of this and mindful of

8
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,407
others who may be in earshot.

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,036
Most importantly, and as horribly fucking

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,206
cliche as this sounds, you really do not have to go through this alone.

11
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,878
And hopefully you'll see this and feel this more and more as you listen.

12
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:48,965
And hey, if this podcast isn't for you, that's fine.

13
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,176
There are lots of them out there.

14
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,471
Find one that speaks to you and helps you.

15
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,432
So, let's talk mental health.

16
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,460

19
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,889
any way, and as such, no content on

20
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:41,893

39
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,935
How many of you are anxious,

40
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,982
distressed, worrying about the world?

41
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,984
What's happening

42
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,194
I'd say a lot.

43
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,201
There's a lot happening.

44
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:29,876
You see it on the news, social media, it's everywhere.

45
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,961
You can you can you can't avoid it.

46
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,422
You cannot avoid it.

47
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,427
We feel dread, the disgust,

48
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:45,934
sick, confused, enraged, so many words, so many words.

49
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,355
because we're not heading in a good direction.

50
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,696
Concerned about the price of eggs, concerned about gas, concerned about whatever you're concerned about.

51
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:06,955
it's's heavy, and definitely weighs on our mental health.

52
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,963
There is a fine line between appropriate

53
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:20,093
concern about what's going on in the world and

54
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,471
clinical anxiety, fine line there.

55
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:27,725
And sometimes it's hard to figure out

56
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,228
where you stand, which side of the line you're on.

57
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,148
When you feel distressed about

58
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:40,989
things happening in the world, of that's a natural response to a real problem.

59
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,743
But when they start to consume you and

60
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,623
take over, you know, your appetite, your

61
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,877
job, how you interact with people, your relationship.

62
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,674
that could be a

63
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:04,012
sign that you may be slightly crossing the

64
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:08,683
line into, you know, clinical, something that might need a different approach to

65
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,436
help you out.

66
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:17,191
So feeling upset about what's happening

67
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,447
is rational.

68
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,491
It shows that you're paying attention.

69
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,870
It shows at the very least, that you're sympathetic.

70
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,959
you know, you're paying attention, you know what's happening, and it should be piss you off.

71
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,920
And for whatever reason,

72
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:43,092
self preservation, primal instinct, our brains are wired

73
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:47,847
to focus on threats, making

74
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:53,686
the information we are taking in, whether the new social media print, whatever

75
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,691
very, very, very impactful, very impactful.

76
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,280
How do you know when it's too much?

77
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,699
How do you know when it's affecting you the most?

78
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,952
Or in a way that is unhealthy?

79
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,705
Because too much can be unhealthy.

80
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:20,463
If you are ruminating and it is all you can think about,

81
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,926
it's a problem.

82
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,178
Um avoidance.

83
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,933
If you don't watch the news anymore, if you don't,

84
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,936
you know, stay abreast of what's happening,

85
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,690
you're avoiding everything that reminds you of what's happening.

86
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,651
That could be a problem.

87
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,487
And catastrophizing, you

88
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,949
know, saying things that the world's gonna end, we're all gonna die.

89
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,954
Those are unhealthy.

90
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,666
I know we feel them, and again,

91
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,586
it's okay to feel how you feel, because feelings aren't

92
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:04,465
always facts, but it's still what you're feeling and it's okay to feel it.

93
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,678
There is a way to worry productively,

94
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:13,182
and there is a way to not worry productively.

95
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,563
And I think an unproductive

96
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,858
way of worrying is simply ruminating, letting

97
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,111
it control you, letting it make you feel how it's going to make you feel

98
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,613
or allowing it to make you feel how you feel

99
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,454
Productive worrying, I think, would

100
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,706
be getting involved.

101
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,959
You know, you're worried, you're pissed,

102
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,880
So what can you do?

103
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,423
Get involved.

104
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,632
That would be productive worrying.

105
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,178
But how do you do it?

106
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,642
How do you. try to help when all you feel is rage?

107
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:01,731
All you feel is disappointment, disgust.

108
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,443
What do you do?

109
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,696
When you think about what's happening and

110
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:13,409
whatever has got you upset, it doesn't have to be what the

111
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,703
convicted rapist is doing today

112
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:21,459
Are you able to identify

113
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,422
where your concerns are.

114
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,341
So let's have a spectrum, right?

115
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,301
We have a spectrum.

116
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,177
In the middle, we have awareness.

117
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,222
In the very bottom of the scale, we have complete avoidance.

118
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,850
And at the very top of the scale, we have excessive worrying

119
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,187
Where are you all on this scale?

120
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:48,361
I'm definitely awareness, but also

121
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,782
a little leaning towards the avoidant side

122
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,201
of the scale and not so much the excessive.

123
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,454
But then it fluctuates back and forth.

124
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:02,208
One day, I'll be like, I don't I don't care, I don't want to see this.

125
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,169
which is what they want you to think.

126
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,881
And then other times I'm excessively

127
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:12,718
worrying because pretty bad shit's happening.

128
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,598
It's easy for me, but not always, to identify

129
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:21,435
which part of that spectrum, that scale that I'm on.

130
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,692
and worrying is not inherently bad, but

131
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,279
it's when it starts to consume you and everything

132
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,699
about you, that's a problem.

133
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,951
We got to find a way to deal with that.

134
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,205
Are there changes in your sweep?

135
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,082
Here are things to look for.

136
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,208
Changes in your sweep, changes in your appetite.

137
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,919
Do you sweep too much?

138
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,337
Do you sweep less?

139
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,922
Are you eating?

140
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,007
Are you not eating?

141
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,468
I don't like how the camera's up there, and it looks like I'm staring down here and I'm not paying attention.

142
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,681
So, sweeping, eating, your ability to focus.

143
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:02,184
Are you able to focus on things that you once cook?

144
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:07,356
Are you able to focus on the things that you need to be able to focus on,

145
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,943
for instance, surviving, being there for your kids,

146
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,615
being there for your loved ones, being there for you

147
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,284
because you have to show up for yourself

148
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,203
or you can't show up for other people.

149
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,500
For instance, those who

150
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,670
have flown or have seen TV shows or movies where people

151
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,965
are flying and sudden wasak cabin pressure and

152
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,844
the oxygen masks drop down, they tell you, put yours on first

153
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,098
and then help someone who may need it next to you.

154
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,602
Because if you can't help yourself first in this situation,

155
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,812
you pass out, you're unconscious.

156
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,732
You can't help somebody if you're not animated, right?

157
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,194
So you need to show up for yourself.

158
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,447
How do you show up for yourself?

159
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,658
It's a good question.

160
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,533
I'm still trying to figure that out.

161
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,327
I think being

162
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,208
aware, being present in the moment,

163
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,963
being mindful, is how you show up for yourself.

164
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,591
If you are in the moment and you are fully aware

165
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:22,223
and you are paying attention to what's happening, that's being mindful.

166
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:30,356
Sometimes being mindful can be painful, but we don't avoid it.

167
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,358
We still have to do it.

168
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,692
We need to be mindful.

169
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:38,447
I think if more people were mindful in the moment,

170
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,201
I think I've used this word the most in this episode.

171
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,455
If we're mindful in that moment, then we

172
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:51,460
can understand, or at least try to, of what's happening.

173
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,381
You can't be rational, you can't have sharp thoughts

174
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,968
if you're anxious, if you're upset, if

175
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,762
you're enraged, you cannot think properly.

176
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,722
The brain just kind of.

177
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,850
It's like, no, I'm pissed, I'm going to focus on this.

178
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,311
I don't want to focus on, well, let's see it from their point of view.

179
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,313
Let's

180
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,440
It's hard.

181
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,399
I know.

182
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:13,899
I know!

183
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,942
I live it.

184
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,444
I know.

185
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,283
But what are some small things we might be able to do to kind of

186
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,952
counteract it, make it a productive worry?

187
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,664
What are some things that you can do this week

188
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:35,463
today, tomorrow, that can help address what you're concerned about?

189
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:40,259
I feel this in my core, what most people are feeling.

190
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,261
You're not alone.

191
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,596
I feel it.

192
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,305
It's enraging.

193
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,431
It keeps me on edge.

194
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,850
It keeps me up at night sometimes.

195
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,939
Like, what are we gonna do for the next four years with this much bullshit?

196
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,318
What are

197
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,361
How do we process it?

198
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,613
What?

199
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,697
How do we focus?

200
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,450
How do we do anything?

201
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,705
A large portion of people despise what's happening in

202
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:13,751
the world and rightfully so, especially here in the U.S. And

203
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,464
there are two popuations who all

204
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,759
want to be heard and understood and be able

205
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,054
to explain from their point of view why what

206
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,557
they see happening is not going to work,

207
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:34,021
or be sustainable, or benefit anyone that isn't in a certain class

208
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,693
And then on the other side, we have another large population

209
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:43,072
of people who love what's

210
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:47,451
happening in the world and the U.S. And this is their jam.

211
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,954
This is they live

212
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,789
for this.

213
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,210
And you're probably thinking, "Well, those people are wrong.

214
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,171
They're stupid.

215
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,174
They're fucking white tr racist rednecks that have zero

216
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:06,220
education and can't understand what's actually happening right in front of them because they can't critically think.

217
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,933
I feel it.

218
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,935
I do.

219
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,772
I have thought it, I have thought worse things, actually.

220
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,859
My brain has come up with some pretty horrible things

221
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,237
that have even scared me at times, but they're passing

222
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,408
thoughts, pass passive, they just kind of pop in there, and then they're gone.

223
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:31,453
Sometimes they stick for 15 years, sometimes they just last for a day.

224
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,707
But they happen, and that's okay.

225
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,711
We can't control what our brain decides to pop into our head.

226
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,713
We cannot control that.

227
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,673
But we can control how we respond to it.

228
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,676
by being mindful.

229
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:49,388
Being in the moment, it's hard.

230
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,390
I know!

231
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,684
But we have to do it.

232
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,644
So we have these two groups of people.

233
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,605
Ah, this is horrible.

234
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,481
Uh.

235
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,482
No, this is how it should be.

236
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,943
It's okay to feel how you feel.

237
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,945
That's the most important thing.

238
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,823
It is okay to feel how you feel,

239
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:11,535
because there's a lot of people who feel the same way

240
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,206
and who are struggling like you are.

241
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,589
Back in the day, we all decided

242
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:30,721
whether society is, what it should be, and we all agreed.

243
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,184
We're going to help each other.

244
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,519
Everyone has a role.

245
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,230
Everyone helps each other.

246
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,523
It takes a village.

247
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,318
and that's what society is.

248
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,695
That's what society was supposed to be.

249
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,159
That story was forced down our throats in school

250
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,329
when in reality, we

251
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,461
We invaded.

252
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,713
We raped, we murdered, we colonized, we enslaved,

253
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:08,759
we did so many horrible things, and we're still doing it today,

254
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,680
none of which of what a society is supposed to be.

255
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,891
Well, that brings

256
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:20,896
up the question, well, whose definition of society do we go off of?

257
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,482
Well, again, in the US,

258
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,694
we decide, right?

259
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,654
Well, we're supposed to.

260
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,908
If a large enough group of people, more

261
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,286
than half, right, say they do or do not want

262
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:42,960
X, okay, then the majority typically gets or doesn't get what they want or don't want.

263
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,922
That's democratic society, right?

264
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,966
But that's not how it works.

265
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,345
If enough people say something and there

266
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,765
is enough money involved, then

267
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,226
shit happens, whether in

268
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,855
our perceived favor or in their perceived

269
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:09,945
favor, and then that brings up another point, ours, theirs.

270
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,699
the division.

271
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,369
There is a reason we were taught

272
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,957
the phrase, "ogether we stand, divided we fall.

273
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,169
I'm sure you remember that.

274
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,172
What was that in history?

275
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,675
Maybe seventh, eighth grade, I think?

276
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,677
Maybe, maybe.

277
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,344
I don't remember.

278
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,179
But what does it mean?

279
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,139
Together we stand dividedider, we fall.

280
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,891
What does that, what does that mean?

281
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,519
It' It's not. another useless quote that we were taught in school.

282
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,147
This one actually matters.

283
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,649
This one means that if we all stood together

284
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,195
all of us came together.

285
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,698
As one, we could get shit done.

286
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,411
But when we're all divided, and everyone is this

287
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:05,459
or everyone is that, and then some are this and some are that, then we can be controlled.

288
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,170
Governed.

289
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,923
Why?

290
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,424
Because nobody wants to stand together.

291
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,426
Why?

292
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,512
Because too many people don't

293
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:20,474
want to understand why other people feel the way they do.

294
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,476
Now, I know that's hard because

295
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,937
you might feel like I do.

296
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,232
Well, I know why they feel this way, because they're racist.

297
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,692
They're Nazis.

298
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,403
They hate anyone that's not them.

299
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,364
They hate anyone that's not white.

300
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,115
They hate anyone

301
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,826
that is not like them.

302
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,456
Together, we stand divided, we fall.

303
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:48,043
If you do not stand for something, you

304
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,462
will fall for anything.

305
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,716
You will be led to do say things

306
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:58,095
that you don't even realize you're being led to do think and

307
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:00,514
say, which is what's happening today.

308
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,895
I've discussed a little before about the media and

309
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:11,233
the 24/7 news cycle, and it's for a reason, right?

310
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,235
We discussed this set up a previous episode.

311
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,320
It is for a reason.

312
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,365
It is the algorithms and social media

313
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,617
are there for a reason.

314
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,036
They were created to amplify

315
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,540
all of the negativity, the misinformation,

316
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,669
all of that bullshit is by design, but

317
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:34,047
because enough people aren't taught how to think critically

318
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,427
they're oblivious to it.

319
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,429
100%.

320
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,182
There are people who are not oblivious to it, and they just simply don't care.

321
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:48,186
I call that trash, but I digress.

322
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,481
These algorithms were created for a reason.

323
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,943
Keeping us all divided is for a reason.

324
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:03,285
This purposefully created unbalanced, rigid

325
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,956
view of reality, and we eat it up.

326
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,210
We eat it up.

327
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,336
Why?

328
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:16,006
Well, we have a clown running the country, a former

329
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,844
TV star, if you will, who

330
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:25,557
whose words and actions are telling a lot of people that

331
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,894
they can do and say anything they

332
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,230
want, because, well, if our

333
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:37,277
asshole in the highest office of the U.S. can do it, then why can't I?

334
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,198
That's a problem.

335
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,450
And by design,

336
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,956
people need to wake the fuck up.

337
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,209
You're being manipulated.

338
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,046
I'm talking to those who support this man.

339
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,048
You're being manipulated.

340
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,425
I just saw a video

341
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,096
of, I think it's Mexicans for Trump

342
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:08,976
or Latinos for Trump, and they're all singing and praising Trump.

343
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,939
and they don't even realize the man fucking hates them and

344
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:20,445
would deport every single one of them legal or not, which he's doing if he had the chance.

345
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:25,033
But they've been so manipulated, their fucking singing and

346
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:29,454
praising his name divided we fall.

347
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,918
Blacks for Trump.

348
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,674
Black people who support Trump, a

349
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:44,136
man that is racist as fuck, who would rather see

350
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:48,473
you dead, but here you are supporting and praising him.

351
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,436
Divided we fall.

352
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,854
I mean,

353
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,654
This 24 hour news cycle, the way we are

354
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,533
fed this information activates this

355
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:10,454
anxiety and these systems in our body that we're not meant

356
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,873
to be on for 24/7.

357
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,169
You know, it can lead.

358
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,212
No, no, no, no, no.

359
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,549
I'm not saying it can lead to, because we all know it will

360
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,551
lead to anxiety.

361
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,553
It will cause you to be depressed.

362
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,263
It will make you feel helpless.

363
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,848
And guess what?

364
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,184
It's by design.

365
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,436
Why?

366
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,480
Because if everyone is anxious and panicked and on the edge of

367
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:42,194
fuckery, then your minds can't be sharp and focus on what is actually happening.

368
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,489
And we will buy into most anything we're told

369
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:50,911
because they know if we're divided, we're going to fall for it.

370
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,955
So the media keeps us in the know,

371
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:57,459
but only, you know, the parts that they want us to know so

372
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,669
that they can keep us in this state

373
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,672
to be governed.

374
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,680
I want to scream at people, and I'm sure you guys you

375
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:16,228
all do as well, to just fucking wake up, open your goddamn eyes, stand up for something.

376
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,439
just fucking wake up.

377
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,066
Like, it's not hard.

378
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,447
Our education system sucks.

379
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,494
And this is not a knock on the educators, because

380
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,539
it's not the educator's fault.

381
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,499
It's not's not

382
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,419
their problem.

383
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,421
They didn't create it.

384
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,136
We are churning out fewer and fewer people with

385
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:55,267
critical thinking skills, or any skills, actually, and again, for a reason.

386
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,938
these educators raise your kids, right?

387
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,940
right?

388
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,567
You put your kids in school from what,

389
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,778
8 to 2, 8 to 3, seven, eight hours a day, Monday through Friday,

390
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,533
kindergarten to 12th grade. teachers are raising your fucking kids.

391
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,328
but you all don't take any issue

392
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,956
to find out what they're teaching your kids.

393
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,501
And then comes up the issue, well, who's to say what

394
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,462
can be taught to my kids and what can't be taught to my kids

395
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,925
Divided, we fall.

396
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,931
We are not the greatest country in the world..

397
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,726
We have never been the greatest country in the world.

398
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,062
We are the richest country in the world

399
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,148
and arguably the most fucked

400
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,401
but we're not the greatest.

401
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:49,571
All of this quote unqu "greatness that the

402
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:53,742
U.S has accomplished was at the expense of other people.

403
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,206
Wake the fuck up.

404
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,711
If destroying everything we

405
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:08,089
touch is greatness, then by

406
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:11,468
God we are the fucking greatest country, and that's disgusting.

407
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,180
It's disgusting.

408
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,937
The reactions, a lot of the reactions were we have to what's happening.

409
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,691
almost identically mirror grief, right?

410
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:32,447
We have denial, anger, depression, bargaining, accepted..

411
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:38,662
The stages of grief, may be reframing how we're feeling

412
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,084
as grief, and think of it as those stages might

413
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,211
help us process it better?

414
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,421
I'm not sure.

415
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,923
I don't like grieving anything.

416
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,925
But

417
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,928
it might help.

418
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,973
It's not not helping me, but it might help someone else.

419
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:08,525
What morals values, traditions

420
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,530
are most important to keep and adhere to

421
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,078
in fucked up times of change that we live in.

422
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,540
What morals, values, and traditions do we hang on to?

423
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,500
Which ones do we keep?

424
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,336
And that brings up a question.

425
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,173
Whose definition of a moral do we go with?

426
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,676
Whose definition of a value?

427
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,636
Whose definition of a tradition?

428
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,306
do we go with?

429
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,641
Well, this is where it falls back to society.

430
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,729
We're all supposed to agree and decide what we believe or don't believe.

431
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,442
But it doesn't work that way.

432
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,824
Who is to say your moral is not

433
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:03,038
OK, but their moral is who is to say that your

434
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,707
tradition is bad, but theirs isn't?

435
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,795
Why do you go to Mexican restaurants and

436
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:15,258
eat the delicious food and then immediately leave

437
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,680
and join the Trump bandwagon and want to deport them off.

438
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,101
I cannot make some of this make sense.

439
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,146
And that's one of the most enraging

440
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:31,983
things is trying to make sense of what the fuck is happening.

441
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,945
You can't, because it doesn't make sense.

442
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,450
It's fucking chaos, chaos doesn't make sense.

443
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,204
The only thing about chaos that makes sense is we know it's fucked up.

444
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,922
Nothing makes sense anymore, and

445
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,841
people are struggling with how to find purpose and hope

446
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,594
in a world that does not make sense.

447
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,931
And we're not even

448
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,976
what, six, seven months into this?

449
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,439
Things were falling apart.

450
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,442
I almost said everything is falling apart, but that's catastroprophizing, and it's not.

451
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,237
A lot of things are falling apart.

452
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,828
And it does seem like a catastrophe, and one could

453
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,914
have argue it is, you know, when human

454
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:32,127
rights are on the docket and being cut left and right

455
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,131
by a convicted rapist, I mean, first of all,

456
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:42,137
We put a fucking convicted rapist in the White House.

457
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,722
I don't understand America.

458
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:51,187
I don't understand the hate.

459
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,566
Now, I understand my hate

460
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,445
for the trash that is causing all of this.

461
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,868
but I don't understand their hate to people who

462
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,913
aren't like them, only because they aren't like them, right?

463
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:12,375
I hate these people because they're doing horrible things.

464
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,712
They only hate us because we're not one of them.

465
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:21,050
I might be able to swallow it a little easier

466
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,929
if they actually had a constructive thought on

467
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,932
why they don't like the people who aren't like them.

468
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,560
But they don't.

469
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:34,022
These are the same people that say, where was Obama during 9/11?

470
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,316
Why was he out playing golf?

471
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,944
He wasn't even fucking president, but here we are.

472
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,905
These are the people that raiseraise our kids.

473
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,823
These are the people that vote.

474
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,992
These are the people that make decisions that should not be making decisions.isions

475
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,957
What who's to say, who can make a decision and who can't?

476
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,670
I can't even find words

477
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,342
on the level

478
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,848
of rage, disgust, anger, disappointment that I have.

479
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:13,436
I cannot find the appropriate words for it.

480
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,944
What do we do?

481
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,030
What do we do?

482
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,698
How do we survive?

483
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,494
I can tell you till I'm blue in the face.

484
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,454
Be mindful.

485
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,956
Put yourself in their shoes.

486
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,165
Think like them.

487
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,421
in certain situations that doesn't help, nor is it productive.

488
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,927
When something is

489
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:53,184
negative and it's probably going to stay negative and not change,

490
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,939
There is no point in trying to understand why

491
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,027
there's no point.

492
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:08,241
You will work yourself up more, trying to understand why somebody thinks the way they do

493
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,954
than if you didn't.

494
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,956
Especially the people we're talking about.

495
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,461
I cannot comprehend the level of

496
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,839
stupid that we are in right now.

497
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,799
I can't.

498
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,426
Like, how?

499
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,177
How?

500
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:35,059
Money, entertainment, greed

501
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:42,942
If you're not enraged, you're not paying attention.

502
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,697
If you are paying attention and you're not enraged,

503
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,200
might want to unpack that.

504
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,789
But the people that need to unpack that don't listen to this podcast.

505
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:01,461
The people that need to unpack that don't because they don't know how.

506
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,465
and or they don't want to to, because they're right, we're wrong.

507
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,177
Yes.

508
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,386
The other side's the same way.

509
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,388
We're right, you're wrong, right?

510
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,057
Who's to say what's right and wrong?

511
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,933
Who's to say what's mor?

512
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,060
Who's to say what's a value?

513
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:24,192
If you are not hurting someone, I think that's good.

514
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,696
If you are hurting someone, that's bad.

515
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,450
Doesn't get any fucking simpler than that.

516
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,453
Don't be a dick.

517
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,996
Be a good person.

518
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,247
Treat people how you want to be treated.

519
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,126
I can guarantee you these other people don't want to

520
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,213
be treated the way they're treating us, because when we do,

521
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,675
we get all these new nicknames from them.

522
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,181
I understand it is hard not to be a dick.

523
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,184
You know, I'm a huge dick.

524
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,436
I'm not gonna lie.

525
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,479
It's just, I don't know.

526
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,189
My genes

527
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:06,150
being in tune to what's been going on in the world,

528
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,445
I don't know, but I'm a dick.

529
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:15,702
And if you come at me with that kind of energy, typically I give it back.

530
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:25,002
But the tit for tat doesn't get anything accomplished, but sometimes it feels good, right?

531
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:28,172
It feels good to be enraged and battle with

532
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:31,634
these people because it makes you feel alive and like you're doing something for a cause

533
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,431
When nine times out of 10, it goes nowhere..

534
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:40,101
You just get more upset and you deal with the frustration,

535
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,688
because these people are fucking clueless, living in La La Land.

536
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,446
I just don't know how we got here.

537
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,198
I mean, I do.

538
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,994
But metaphorically, I don't.

539
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,671
It's a very gloomy day today.

540
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,465
The sky is gray.

541
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,176
It's raining, just. gently, nice breeze.

542
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,179
I love gloomy days.

543
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:20,224
But when I'm in a certain mood, they kind of amplify that

544
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,935
mood, and today's one of those days.

545
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,357
I just, I so hard

546
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:31,444
to comprehend the amount of stupid that exists.

547
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,702
Some people say, "Well, they're uneducated."

548
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,457
A lot of these people have degrees.

549
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:50,171
PhDs, top of their field, highly educated.

550
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:55,092
but still believe what they believe.

551
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,221
How do you get so high highly educated and

552
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,390
still keep that closed mind?

553
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,392
How do you do it?

554
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,692
I'm sad for the world.

555
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:17,824
I'm sad for the people who feel hopeless.

556
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,826
I'm sad.

557
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,953
I'm disgusted

558
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,330
that this is where we are.

559
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,209
You have to stand.

560
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:35,424
sitting by the sidelines and watching what's happening isn't gonna change anything.

561
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:40,012
And I know some of you were thinking, even if there was enough enough

562
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,349
of us to try to make a change, it still wouldn't happen because of,

563
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,560
you know, how things are stacked against us.

564
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,021
You know, when the government keeps you crushed and

565
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,858
then penalizes you because you can't take the weight

566
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,443
what the fuck?

567
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:02,702
But yes, let's keep voting for these people.

568
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:08,124
Let's keep a weaving what's they feed us and promise

569
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:12,503
us, how many of you dumb fuckers who probably aren't even listening,

570
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,589
you didn't even know what a goddamn tariff was.

571
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,466
You thought I was the greatest fucking thing in the world.

572
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,845
You all quickly changed your tune when you figured it out.

573
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,181
I'm struggling, y'all.

574
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,184
I am struggling to

575
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:30,188
find direct direction and purpose and

576
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,983
meaning in this world.

577
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,949
You know, I had music at one time to kind

578
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:45,620
of escape with and comfort, but the whole fucking

579
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,705
hearing problem ruined that.

580
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:54,962
I'm not sure what outlet to help get this out.

581
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,964
I don't know.

582
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,135
It would be great if it was violence.

583
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:06,974
Of course, I'd feel good beating the fucking out of these dumbasses, but that won't accomplish anything.

584
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:11,354
And then I am sunk to their level, and I refuse

585
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,190
to be seen as that stupid.

586
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,900
I refuse.

587
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,115
So what do we have, just being mindful?

588
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,117
I know.

589
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,702
It's not a lot to go on.

590
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,995
I know.

591
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,329
I know.

592
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:34,001
Sometimes being mindful can enhance

593
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,213
the bad feeling, because you're more focused on it.

594
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,633
I know.

595
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,681
I don't have the answers for this.

596
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:50,434
I don't I don't have the answers.

597
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:57,441
Everyone is just trying to do what they can to survive and not lose their shit.

598
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,944
Everyone is trying to

599
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:05,950
understand what's happening and find ways to not let it happen again.

600
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,454
I don't think civilization.

601
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,207
Okay, civilizations, all the ones before

602
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:18,212
us, don't live long enough to learn from our past.

603
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:21,424
I mean, look at us.

604
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,719
We have it documented in history.

605
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,721
We know what happened.

606
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,432
Here we are.

607
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,148
I don't have I wish I had more people.

608
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,150
I wish I had more to give you.

609
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,448
We have to stand up for something.

610
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:50,953
We can't stay divided.

611
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:56,417
It has gotten us nowhere in the history of this country.

612
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,419
It has gotten us nowhere.

613
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,675
Other people, it's gotten them somewhere.

614
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,471
Same people that have put us where we

615
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,474
are, they get what they want

616
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,935
They retain their power,

617
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,940
and we continuously put them there.

618
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,693
Why?

619
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,948
Why are we so naive and stupid and continue to let this happen?

620
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,953
I'm sad for the world.

621
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,959
Do you know what it's like to feel sad for people you don't know?

622
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,673
It's an odd feeling.

623
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,181
I don't even know how to end this episode.

624
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,438
Just wake up.

625
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,150
Again, I don't think my demographic is

626
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,862
the people that need to wake up listening to this, but I mean, if you are

627
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,284
wake up, you're being lied to.

628
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,245
You're being manipulated.

629
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:19,125
and if you're okay with that, then you're okay with that.

630
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,669
It's your life to be okay with, right?

631
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,213
If you're okay with that, then you're okay with that.

632
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,423
I just wouldn't think

633
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:32,429
being told what to do and manipulated is what people want.

634
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,687
Don't give up.

635
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,438
I guess that's what I'll leave you with.

636
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:43,232
Don't give up.

637
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:51,699
We have gotten through worse, and that's just disgusting to say.

638
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,870
We have gotten through worse, so let's keep going.

639
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,872
We'll get through this.

640
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,456
It's so disgusting.

641
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,460
but it's all I have.

642
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,920
Don't give up.

643
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,177
Keep fighting

644
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,683
unless you're them, then just fucking stop breathing so we all can get on them with our lives.
